Student Notes: 
1.	Work	and	Employment	
Work can be defined as the carrying out of tasks requiring the expenditure of mental and 
physical effort with the objective of production of goods and services that cater to human 
needs. While Employment is a contract between two parties, where the work is paid for.  
Worker  is  a  person  who  enters  into  employment  out  of  his  own  will.  On  the  nature  of 
employment, work can be of two types:  
1) Formal  Work: It  is  the  work  where  the  worker  is  governed  by  the  formal  rules  and 
regulations. These rules and regulations may be defined by legislations or statutes of the 
government. All the public sector establishments and those private sector establishments 
which employ 10 hired workers or more are called formal sector.  
2) Informal Work: It is the work where the workers are not governed by the fixed rules, but by 
the directions of employers. Unfortunately, in India, more than 80% of the workforce is in 
the informal sector where they have low social security. It includes farmers, agricultural 
labourers, owners of small enterprises etc.  
Since informal sector is not regulated by the laws and statutes of the government, they are 
more vulnerable to exploitation. Their wages and tenure are not regularized. They can’t form 
trade union which minimizes their bargaining capacity with their employers.  
Definition of ‘formal’ worker 
In India, there exist various definitions of ‘formal worker’, such as: 
• Those employed with enterprises registered under the Factories Act, 1948 (thus excludes 
those in services sector) 
• Those in enterprises with 10 or more workers and all government workers 
• Those who have a contract regardless of the size of the enterprise in which they work 
(Arjun Sengupta Committee Report) 
A formal job is generally understood as regular salaried job in government establishments or 
private enterprises and one that comes with entitlement to one or more of the following social 
security benefits: provident fund, pension, gratuity, healthcare and maternity.  
Organized versus Unorganized 
In  India,  the  term  “organized  enterprise”  was  originally  used  to  refer  to  the  enterprises 
registered under the Factories Act, 1948. Industrial enterprises with 20 or more workers if not 
using power and 10 or more workers if using power are required to register under this Act. But 
in some contexts, the term has been widened to include all enterprises with 10 or more 
workers in both industry and services. By implications, enterprises with less than 10 workers are 
called unorganized enterprises.   
1.1.	Nature	of	Employment	in	India		
The nature of employment in India is multifaceted. Some get employment throughout the year 
while some others get employed for only a few months in a year. Therefore the economic 
planning in India aims to utilise the available resources in a manner which would maximise the 
rate  of  growth  with  optimal  employment  generation.  Following  are  the  key  features  of 
employment in India:  
• Ruralization:  During 2011-12, India had about 473 million strong workforce. About 3/4th of 
them are rural workers. About 70 per cent of the workers are men and the rest are women. 
• Informalisation: According to the International Labour Organization, 81% of the labour is 
working  in  the  informal  sector,  with  only  6.5%  in  the  formal  sector  and  0.8%  in  the 
household sector. 
• Casualization: The  phenomena  of  shift  from  regular  salaried  employment  and  self 
employment to casual wage work is called ‘casualization of the workforce’. Statistics show

Student Notes: 
that there has been a gradual increase in the casual workforce over the last few decades.  
• Masculinization: India’s  female  Labour  Force  Participation  Rate  (LFPR)  has  fallen  to  a 
historic low of 23.3% in 2017-18. It means that over three out of four women in India are 
neither working nor seeking work. This would imply that they are most likely engaged in the 
household chores. This leads to under-valuation of women’s contribution to the economy 
as a whole.  
These issues arise mainly because India's economy is highly informalized. There is need to a 
formal economy. 
1.2.	Formalization	of	Indian	Economy	
Formalization means creation and expansion of formal jobs, essentially, that come with social 
security, financial inclusion and legal empowerment of the workforce.  
Advantages of formalization  
• Increased tax revenues for the government due to better reporting under taxation laws 
• Coverage of population under social protection plans, saving from financial distress during 
difficult times 
• Increase workers’ welfare and the opportunities for decent jobs 
• Reduce unfair competition between formal and informal enterprises arising from tax or 
regulatory arbitrage  
Downsides of formalization 
• Exclusion of population, if knee-jerk steps are taken e.g. demonetization 
• Poverty  and  destitution  as  rapid  formalization  imposes  additional  costs  on  informal 
economy. 
How should we go about it? 
• Stress on creation of high-productivity high- paying jobs (more under ‘job creation’) 
• Build synergies between different sectors of economy, by inter-Ministries’ coordination.  
• Ensure employability by addressing skill- mismatch, formal skill training and re-training.  
• Improve women’s participation in the economy, in line with SDG 5 on Gender Equality.  
• Slow  transition  of  informal  sector  into  the  formal  economy,  to  avoid  downsides  of 
formalization process.  
Devising  a National  Employment  Policy would go  a  long  way  in  ensuring  coherent  and 
converging actions for formalization of Indian economy.  
 
1.3.	Sector	Wise	Employment	in	India	
As  per  Employment-Unemployment  Survey  (by  NSSO)  of  2011-12  (latest  available),  total 
workforce employed stands at 47.36 crore; with 23.16 crore in agriculture and 24.2 crore in 
industry and services.

SECTOR-WISE EMPLOYMENT: NSSO 
 
2.	Unemployment	
Unemployment is a situation in which individuals are ready and willing to work at the prevailing 
rate of wages but cannot get the work. According to the NSSO, unemployment is a situation in 
which all those who, owing to lack of work, are not working but either seek work through 
employment  exchanges,  intermediaries,  friends  or  relatives  or  by  making  applications  to 
prospective employers or express their willingness or availability for work under the prevailing 
conditions of work and remunerations 
Number of unemployed = Labour Force - Work force 
Where, workforce = working or being engaged in economic activity and labour force = work 
force + not engaged in economic activity and either making tangible efforts to seek work or 
being available for ‘work’ if the work is available. 
2.1.	Types	of	Unemployment	
a) Cyclical unemployment: This kind of unemployment occurs when all those who want to 
work cannot be employed because there is not enough demand in the market for their 
work. It is called as cyclical unemployment because it varies with the trade cycle. For 
example, when the economy is doing well there would be greater demand for the goods, 
but the opposite is true for the years when the economy slows down. For example: In the 
aftermath of the US subprime crisis, many people lost their jobs.  
b) Frictional Unemployment: This kind of unemployment occurs when a person leaves/loses a 
job and starts looking for another one. This search for a job may take a considerable 
amount of time resulting in frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment tends to be 
on a high when an economy is not doing so well. This kind of unemployment may also be 
high in an economy if people change jobs frequently due to high level of dissatisfaction with 
the working conditions in the economy.  
c) Seasonal  Unemployment: This  kind  of  unemployment  is  expected  to  occur during 
certain parts of the year. For example, tourism related jobs at a hill station may experience 
seasonal  unemployment  during  the  winter months .  Another  example  could  be  the 
seasonal unemployment in agriculture depending upon the success of monsoon. Similarly if 
irrigation facilities are missing, only one crop may be produced in a year, rendering the 
farmer unemployed for the rest of the year.  
d) Structural Unemployment: This kind of unemployment happens when the structure of an 
industry changes. For example, as the country is tending to move from use of bicycles to 
motorcycles,  the  demand  for  labor  in  the  cycle  industry  continuously  falls.  Therefore, 
structural unemployment essentially occurs when there exists a mismatch between the 
skills of the unemployed and the skills needed for the job. Changes in technology and

Student Notes: 
changes in tastes are two big reasons for the occurring of structural unemployment in the 
economy.  One of the reasons why NITI Ayog focuses on skill development is to address the 
problem of structural unemployment in the country.  
e) Underemployment: This term can be used in multiple connotations but one of the primary 
usage is to showcase a situation where a person with high skills works in low wage and low 
skill jobs.  
f) Disguised  Unemployment:   Such  type  of  unemployment  is  quite  common  in  the 
agricultural sector in India. It occurs when people are employed in a job where their 
presence or absence does not make any difference to the output of the economy. Because 
of large families in the rural areas several people work on farms and at times the work of 2-
3 people is done by 4-5 people. 
g) Open unemployment – this refers to a situation where there are some workers who have 
absolutely no work to do. They are willing to work at the prevailing wage rate, but they are 
forced to remain unemployed in the absence of work. These workers are completely idle. 
Such unemployment is clearly visible as the number of such person can be clearly counted 
and therefore it is known as open unemployment. It is found largely in cities and to a 
limited extent in rural areas. Frictional, structural and cyclical are different types of open 
unemployment. 
h) Natural  unemployment – Unemployment  ranging  between  2  to  3%  in  the  country  is 
considered natural and inevitable. This minimal percentage of unemployment cannot be 
eliminated at all. It is called natural unemployment. 
Full Employment: It is a situation when every able-bodied adult works the number of hours 
considered normal for a fully employed person. 
The case of Jobless growth  
It  is  an  economic  phenomenon  in  which  a  macro  economy  experiences  growth  while 
maintaining or decreasing its level of employment. India faced jobless growth from period 
2004-05 to 2009-10. The robust growth witnessed by India, has been mostly associated with a 
rapid  rise  in  labour  productivity,  rather  than  an  expansion  in  employment.  The  total 
employment grew by only 0.1 per cent during five years till 2009-10 (from 457.9 million in 
2004-05 to 458.4 million in 2009-10), while labour productivity grew by more than 34 per cent 
in total during this period 
Over-emphasis on services and neglect of the manufacturing were mainly responsible for this 
phenomenon. The number of people seeking jobs are growing in India and they need to be 
constructively  engaged  to  avoid  socio-economic  conflict  and  arrest  the  increasing 
Informalisation in the economy. 
Experts argue that the growth of manufacturing will be the key for growth in income and 
employment for multiple reasons. For every job created in the manufacturing sector, three 
additional jobs are created in related activities. The other is that manufacturing in India is 
scalable and has higher labour absorption in comparison to services. 
2.2.	Nature	of	Unemployment	in	India	
• Since India is a developing country, the nature of unemployment is starkly different from 
the developed countries. In developed countries unemployment is primarily driven by a fall 
in demand. As the demand for goods and services fall, the industries have to stop the 
production thus rendering the workers jobless.    
• But in India under-employment or disguised unemployment is a major concern. This is not 
due to the lack of demand for goods but due to the shortage of capital equipment for 
setting up new industries. This creates supply side constraints in the economy.  Because of 
the lack of capital, India has not been able to commensurately meet the needs of the

Student Notes: 
growing labour force in the country. This manifests itself in two ways- firstly, the prevalence 
of  large  scale  unemployment  in  the  urban  areas; secondly,  in  the  growing  numbers 
engaging themselves in the agricultural sector resulting in disguised unemployment.  
• The basic solution to the entire problem is faster rate of capital formation so as to enlarge 
employment opportunities. For this the government needs to encourage savings and their 
productive utilization in increasing the rate of investment.  
• The state itself can participate in the process of capital formation by undertaking such 
development  activities  since  the  private  entrepreneurs  do  not  find it  profitable  to 
undertake. There is also a need for the government to increase and attract more foreign 
investment.  
2.3.	Measuring	Unemployment	
Currently,  the  National  Sample  Survey  Office  (NSSO)  is  the  principal  source  of  data  on 
employment. Comparable survey rounds of sample populations are done once in five years. 
Ministry  of  Statistics  and  Programme  Implementation  (MOSPI)  has  decided  to  conduct 
quarterly and annual surveys of employment.  
In measuring employment/unemployment in a country like India, certain specific features of 
the workforce need to be taken into account. The structure of workforce with dominance of 
self-employment  and  primary  sector  tends  to  depress  unemployment  rates  in  general. 
Inadequacy of the measure of unemployment in terms of open unemployment has, therefore, 
been well recognised by the method adopted by NSSO.  
Therefore, National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) uses three different concepts.  
• Usual Principal Status - A person is considered unemployed on Usual Status (US) basis, if 
he/she was not working, but was either seeking or available for work for the major part of 
the reference year. It is generally regarded as the measure of chronic open unemployment. 
Projections of labour force and employment have been made on the usual status concept, 
and qualified, where necessary, on the basis of the other two concepts below. 
• Current  Weekly  Status - On the basis of a week as the reference period, a person is 
considered unemployed by Current Weekly Status (CWS), if he/she had not worked even for 
one hour during the week, but was seeking or available for work. The CWS unemployment 
rates also measure chronic unemployment, but with the reduced reference period of a 
week. 
• Current  Daily  Status - The third concept of unemployment is the Current Daily Status 
(CDS), which is in terms of total person days of unemployment, and is the aggregate of all 
the unemployment days of all persons in the labour force during the reference week. The 
CDS  is  considered  to  be  a  comprehensive  measure  of  unemployment,  including  both 
chronic and invisible unemployment. 
Improving Employment Data  
Report of the NITI Aayog’s Task Force (released in 2017) made recommendations to create a 
21st century statistical system in India for the generation of comprehensive employment, 
unemployment and wage estimates on a sustained basis. These include: 
• Conduct of household surveys on an annual basis. 
• Introduction of time-use survey, that be conducted every three years (such surveys also 
help in measuring women’s participation in unpaid work). 
• Use of technology for faster and better data collection, processing and assimilation. 
• Introduction of annual enterprise survey using enterprises registered with the GSTN as the 
sample frame. 
• Separate annual survey of enterprises excluded from the GSTN database (i.e. those in 
health and education sectors, and those with turnover < INR 20 Lakh in other sectors).

• (-) These are conducted every five years 
• (-) Time lag between data collection and availability of the results 
• E.g. - Employment-Unemployment Survey (NSSO), Annual Labour Force Survey (Labour 
Bureau) 
Enterprise Surveys: 
• (+) Better accuracy than Household surveys, in accessing industry structure, wages and 
other employment characteristics 
• (-) Available sample frames may not cover small, unorganized enterprises 
• (-) Self-employed and farm workers are excluded

2.4.	Unemployment	Rate	
Unemployment rate is defined as the number of people who were unable to find a job (though 
they were looking for jobs), as a ratio of total number of people who were looking for jobs. 
Unemployment in India 
• ILO report  "World  Employment  and  Social  Outlook  Trends - 2018":  The  number  of 
unemployed persons in India is expected to rise from 18.3 million in 2017 to 18.6 million in 
2018 and 18.9 million by 2019. At the same time, the unemployment rate is expected to 
remain static at 3.5 per cent. 
• The World Bank in its comprehensive report on India’s economy opines that India needs to 
create a lot of salaried jobs (formal jobs) to meet the working population demands and step 
up its growth to a middle-income country. 
• About 65 percent of the population in the country has an average age of less than 35 years. 
A large section of unemployed within this can become a demographic burden for India.

Student Notes: 
NSSO 68th Round Survey: Key facts 
• The unemployment rate in urban areas reduced from 4.5% in 2004-05 to 3.4% in 2011-12. 
While in urban areas it reduced from 4.5% in 2004-05 to 3.4% in 2011-12. 
• Unemployment rate across all the religious groups in rural areas was on the lower side 
compared to urban areas for both males and females. 
• The most astonishing finding was that Christians have the highest rate of unemployment in 
both rural (4.5%) and urban (5.9%) areas in 2011-12.  
• While the unemployment rate in rural areas has decreased for Sikhs (lowest among all 
religious groups) it has slightly increased for Muslims. At 3.3%, Hindus have the lowest 
unemployment rate in urban areas. 
• Self-employment is the major source of income for almost half the households, across all 
religious groups, in rural areas, followed by casual labour. 
2.5.	Labour	Force	Participation	Rate	
• The labour force participation rate measures the proportion of people in the working-age 
(16 - 64years) group who are actually available for work.  
• Following are few findings from the latest report by the NSSO:  
○ The labour force participation rate (LFPR) stood at 49.8 per cent in 2017-18, falling 
sharply from 55.9 % in 2011-12.  
○ The proportion of the active labour force declined twice for females between 2011-12 
and 2017-18.  
○ The fall in LFPR was far more in rural areas, from 67.7% to 58.7%, than in urban areas, 
from 49.3% to 47.6%. The gap in LFPR has narrowed between urban and rural areas due 
to a decline in the active labour force in villages.  
• There is a small decline in labour force participation among men in the working-age group, 
attributable to their increasing preference for higher education. The decline in labour force 
participation among children and, especially, women is attributable to declining poverty. 
2.6.	Women’s	Participation	in	the	Labour	Force	
• The relatively low proportion of working women in India is one of the most significant 
obstacles to economic progress. The difference in the labour participation rate of the two 
main genders in India is over 50 percentage points, one of the highest among G-20 nations, 
according to World Bank data.  
• The labour force participation rate of women in urban areas is less than the participation of 
women in rural areas. 
Reasons for low participation 
• lower wages for women  
• the  inability  to  provide  flexibility,  childcare  benefits  and  maternity  leaves  creates 
disincentives for women to seek work outside the home 
• gender discrimination in Indian society - low social status of women compared to men  
• security issues also hinder labour mobility among women 
Economic Consequence of Low participation of Women-  
• A new study by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that India’s gross domestic product 
(GDP) in 2025 can be higher by as much as 60% if women’s participation in the economy 
were on par with that of men.  
• A study by Asian Development Bank (ADB) also points to the similar fact. It says that if 
women’s participation in India increases to the level prevailing in the advanced countries, 
annual GDP will be higher by 4.2%.  
• No country can attain its full potential if half of its human capital is unable to contribute 
fully to its growth and development. India is no exception.

Student Notes: 
NITI Ayog’s 3 Year Action Agenda (2017-2020) 
• Job creation in Industry and Services 
• Create Coastal Employment Zones to boost exports and generate high-productivity jobs. 
• Enhance labour-market flexibility through reforming key laws 
• Address the high and rising share of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India’s banks through 
supporting the auction of larger assets to private asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), 
and strengthening the State Bank of India-led ARC. 
• Action  points  for  specific  sectors- Apparel,  Leather  and  footwear,  Electronics,  Food 
processing, Gems and jewelry, Tourism, Finance, Real estate. 
2.7.	Reasons	for	Unemployment	
India has comparative advantage in terms of cheaper and more abundant labour. But this is 
nullified by other factors that render them less competitive than their peers in competitor 
countries. 
• Defective  education  system - Failing  education  system  that  creates  thousands  of 
‘unemployable graduates’. National Employability Report for Engineers (Aspiring MInds)  
reveals that over 80 per cent of Indian engineers are unemployable  
• Slow  economic  growth - Inadequate job creation (therefore non-farm  sector (such as 
manufacturing)  needs to be encouraged as farm land is limited)  
• Lack  of  infrastructural  development- India is behind its competitors when it comes to 
infrastructure such road and logistics. The costs and time involved in getting goods from 
factory to destination are greater than those for other countries.  
• Poor ranking in Global Competitiveness Index-reflected in the high average tariff that India 
is  maintaining  on  its  imports,  low  level  of  factor  accumulation,  and  relatively  high 
incremental capital-output ratio. India has slipped 10 ranks in the latest Global Competitive 
Index.  
• Rapid population growth - Skilling and job creation is hard to catch up with a rapid growing 
population especially when the population base is large and the institutions and policies are 
not  effective in creating quality jobs. 
• Inadequate employment planning by government in comparison to the population growth.  
• Lack of entrepreneurship culture- India needs to develop a culture of job-providers than 
being a job-seeker among its youth. 
2.8.	Consequences	of	Unemployment	
• Unrest in population – especially the youth- The Jaat reservation stir in Haryana is a visible 
manifestation of violent form of the problem of unemployment. Similarly other locally 
dominant caste and communities like Patels in Gujarat, Kapu community in Andhra Pradesh, 
Gujjar in Rajasthan are also demanding reservation in employment.  
• Low  economic  growth – The  human  capital  of  a  nation  is  not  fully  utilized if  the 
unemployment rate is high. It turns the people who are an asset into a liability. Increase in 
unemployment is an indicator of a depressed economy. 
• Vicious cycles of Poverty – Unemployment and poverty feed are the two sides of the same 
coin with one leading to the other. It also reduces demand which in turn affect other 
sectors of the economy. 
• Lower  social  indicators  &  burden  on  government – Unemployment  leads  to  reduced 
spending  on  health  and  education  by  people.  This  affects  social  indicators  of      the 
population.  
• Source  of  exploitation - People  cannot  remain  completely  unemployed  for  very  long 
because of their desperate economic condition. Thus, they are forced to accept jobs that 
may be unpleasant or exploitative.

Student Notes: 
• Loss  of  labour  efficiency – When a person is out of work for long, his/her efficiency 
decreases as a result of loss of skills and work habits.  
• Adverse effects on savings – As the employed person have to take care of the unemployed 
ones in the family, their capacity to save falls.  
• Leads to inequalities of income – Unemployment pushes people to poverty. During the 
period of mass unemployment, the extent of poverty and inequality of income tends to 
increase. 
2.9.	Steps	Taken	by	the	Government	to	Tackle	Unemployment	
India is midway through its demographic dividend – a period of time when demography gives 
economic growth a boost by expanding the working-age share of the population. To exploit the 
dividend and meeting the aspirations of people entering the labour force, India’s economy 
needs to create enough “good jobs”. Many steps have been taken for increasing employment in 
recent times.  
• National Rural LIvelihood Mission: Two initiatives for skill development are undertaken 
under this scheme:  
○ Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana:  It is a placement linked 
skill development program which allows skilling in a PPP mode and assured placements 
in regular jobs in an organization not owned by the skilled person. 
○ Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETI): It enables the trainee to take 
Bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise 
• Make in India: It aims at promoting India as an important investment destination and a 
global hub for manufacturing, design and innovation.  
• Startup India Programme: It aims to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and 
startups  in  the  country  which  will  drive  economic  growth  and  generate  large  scale 
employment opportunities. 
• Mudra  Scheme: It  provides  access  to  institutional  finance  to  unfunded  micro  /  small 
business units by extending loans upto Rs.10 lakh for manufacturing, processing, trading, 
services  and  activities  allied  to  agriculture,  which  help  in  creating  income  generating 
activities and employment. 
• Stand  Up  India: It  provides  access  to  institutional  finance  to  unfunded  micro  /  small 
business units by extending loans upto Rs.10 lakh for manufacturing, processing, trading, 
services  and  activities  allied  to  agriculture,  which  help  in  creating  income  generating 
activities and employment.  
• National  Manufacturing  Policy to  engage  in  job  creation  numbering  10  crore  work 
opportunities by 2022.  
• National  Urban  Livelihoods  Mission:  It focuses on organizing urban poor in self help 
groups, creating opportunities for skill development leading to market-based employment 
and helping them to set up self-employment ventures by ensuring easy access to credit.  
3.	Relationship	 between	 Unemployment	 and	 Inflation	
Rate	
• Professor Phillips, emphasized that there exists a close relationship between the level of 
unemployment and the rate of wage increase in an economy. This relationship between the 
two is depicted in the form of Phillips curve.  
• It is a graphic curve, which advocates a relationship between inflation and unemployment 
in an economy. As per the curve there is a ‘trade off’ between inflation and unemployment 
i.e. an inverse relationship between them. The curve suggests that lower inflation, higher 
unemployment and higher inflation, lower unemployment.

4.	Potential	Sectors	for	Employment	Generation	
At present almost half of India’s population is concentrated in the agricultural sector. In fact the 
agricultural sector shows signs of disguised  employment and low  productivity. There is an 
urgent need to take workforce out of this sector towards manufacturing and services. Creating 
jobs in the latter sectors is India’s central challenge. India needs to generate jobs that are formal 
and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the 
potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. 
Moreover, India's growth has to be led by manufacturing, not services because, among other 
reasons, employment elasticity is higher in manufacturing. Also, a large section of the labour 
force has little or no education, and cannot be employed in skilled jobs in the services sector. 
Nor can they be easily skilled, given their lack of basic education. Outside agriculture, they can 
only be employed in low-skill jobs in the manufacturing sector. 
 
Meeting the challenge of jobs may require paying attention to labour-intensive sectors. The 
apparel and leather sectors meet many desirable attributes for policy attention: bang- for buck 
for creating jobs, especially for women, opportunities for exports and growth. Nearly every 
successful economic growth take-off in post-war history in East Asia has been associated with 
rapid expansion in clothing and footwear exports in the early stages. Apparels and Leather 
sectors offer tremendous opportunities for creation of jobs, especially for women.

Student Notes: 
Rising labor costs means that China is gradually vacating its dominant position in these sectors, 
affording India an opportunity. To not cede this space to competitors such as Vietnam and 
Bangladesh will require easing restrictions on labor regulations, negotiating FTAs with major 
partners such as the EU and UK, and ensuring that the GST rationalizes current tax policy that 
can discriminate against dynamic sectors. 
25 focus sectors under MSME 
‘Make in India’ aims at projecting India as an investment destination and develop it as a 
global hub for manufacturing, design and innovation. The ‘Make in India’ initiative does not 
target manufacturing sector alone, but also aims at promoting entrepreneurship in the 
country. Under the initiative various components have been identified which will lead to 
creation of a positive investment climate.  These components involve improvement in Ease 
of Doing Business, creation of modern infrastructure, opening of new Sectors for FDI and 
change in the mindset of government agencies from being regulators to facilitators.  
As part of Make in India initiative, 25 focus sectors have been identified in which there is an 
Action Plan which has been approved to encourage and promote investments in those 
sectors. These sectors include Textiles, Tourism and Hospitality, Leather, Pharmaceuticals, 
Electronic System Design and Manufacturing, Food processing, construction, Aviation etc. 
 
Employment prospects in India’s IT Sector: Robust Outlook 
Indian IT sector employment prospects, both in the near and long-term are expected to be 
broadly positive and encouraging for the future. India IT companies currently serve two 
thirds of the fortune 500 companies and have created 40 lakhs direct jobs in India. 
India’s total software product market grew at 9.5% in FY2017 to reach USD 7 billion. In 
comparison, the domestic market grew much faster, at 10.4%, reaching USD 4.8 billion.  
The emerging and promising digital economy in the country is going create a very powerful 
potential for job creation. The Government is encouraging greater stress on cyber security 
and this will lead to greater focus on innovation, research and thus significant potential for 
job creation.

1.	Poverty	
“Poverty is the worst form of violence.” 
This quote by Mahatma Gandhi precisely sums up the overall impact of poverty on the lives of 
the poor. It places many disabilities hampering the development of the poor by restricting their 
freedoms and trapping generations in poverty if adequate level of support is not provided to 
them.  
The  natural  questions  that  rise  are- What  is  poverty?  What are  its  causes?  How  is  poverty 
measured? What steps have been taken to mitigate poverty? What more needs to be done? We 
will find answers to these in subsequent sections of this document. 
1.1.	What	is	Poverty?	
Poverty, in simplest terms, is a condition where people are unable to fulfil basic needs of life 
such as- food, clothes, shelter etc. for want of money. Over the time, poor access to healthcare 
services, education and poor standard of living have also come to be attributed to poverty. 
1.2.	Types	of	Poverty	
Poverty is defined in either relative or absolute terms. Absolute poverty measures poverty in 
relation to the amount of money necessary to meet basic needs such as food, clothing, and 
shelter. United Nations defines it as a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic 
human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education 
and information. It depends not only on income but also access to service. The World Bank has 
defined the absolute poverty line as the percentage of population of country living on less than 
$1.90 a day (PPP) at constant prices at 2011 price levels. 
However, the concept of absolute poverty is not concerned with broader quality of life issues or 
with  the  overall level  of  inequality in  society.  The  concept  therefore  fails  to  recognize  that 
individuals  have  important  social  and  cultural  needs.  This,  and  similar  criticisms,  led  to  the 
development of the concept of relative poverty.  
Relative poverty defines poverty in relation to the economic status of other members of the 
society:  people  are  poor  if  they  fall  below  prevailing  standards  of  living  in  a  given  societal 
context. One of its criticisms is that it is merely a measure of inequality, using the term 'poverty' 
for it is misleading. For example, if everyone in a country's income doubled, it would not reduce 
the amount of 'relative poverty' at all. However, others have pointed out that the problem of 
poverty in the industrialized nations today is mostly a problem of relative poverty. That after 
a certain minimum level of economic development the effects of poverty is not seen in any 
absolute form but the effects of the contrast, daily perceived, between the lives of the poor and 
the lives of those around them. Nonetheless, poverty is not equal to inequality and both are 
two distinct concepts affecting each other which we will deal with later in this document. 
Other Ways of Categorizing the Poor- 
Chronic  Poor- People  who  are  always  poor  and  those  who  are  usually  poor  but  who  may 
sometimes have a little more money (example: casual workers) are grouped together as the 
chronic poor. 
Churning Poor- Another group are the churning poor who regularly move in and out of poverty 
(example: small farmers and seasonal workers). 
Occasionally Poor- Those who are rich most of the time but may sometimes have a patch of 
bad luck. They are called the transient poor.

1.3.	Measuring	Poverty	
For the purpose of defining poverty, we divide people into two categories; the poor and the 
non-poor and the poverty line separates the two. However, there are many kinds of poor; the 
absolutely poor, the very poor and the poor. Similarly, there are various kinds of non-poor; the 
middle class, the upper middle class, the rich, the very rich and the absolutely rich. Think of this 
as a line or continuum from the very poor to the absolutely rich with the poverty line dividing 
the poor from the non-poor. 
 
The Poverty Line: Poverty Line is a monetary threshold under which an individual is considered 
to  be  living  in  poverty. National Sample Survey Organization is the institution which collects 
data regarding estimation of poverty in India. There are many ways of measuring poverty. One 
way is to determine it by the monetary value (per capita expenditure) of the minimum calorie 
intake that was estimated at 2,400 calories for a rural person and 2,100 calories for a person in 
the  urban  area.  Based  on  this,  in 2011-12,  the  poverty  line  was  defined for  rural  areas  as 
consumption worth Rs 816 per person a month and for urban areas it was Rs 1,000. Thus the 
government uses Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) as proxy for income of households to 
identify the poor. 
Poverty Estimation in Pre-independent India 
In pre-independent India, Dadabhai Naoroji was the first to discuss the concept of a Poverty 
Line. He used the menu for a prisoner and used appropriate prevailing prices to arrive at what 
may be called ‘jail cost of living’. However, only adults stay in jail whereas, in an actual society, 
there are children too. He, therefore, appropriately adjusted this cost of living to arrive at the 
poverty line. 
Poverty Estimation in Independent India 
In 1962, the Planning Commission constituted a working group to estimate poverty nationally, 
and it formulated separate poverty lines for rural and urban areas – of Rs 20 and Rs 25 per 
capita per year respectively. VM Dandekar and N Rath made the first systematic assessment of 
poverty  in  India  in  1971,  based  on  National  Sample  Survey  (NSS)  data  from  1960-61.  They 
argued  that  the  poverty  line  must  be  derived  from  the  expenditure  that  was  adequate  to 
provide 2250  calories  per  day  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  This  generated  debate  on 
minimum calorie consumption norms while estimating poverty and variations in these norms 
based on age and sex.

Student Notes: 
Alagh Committee (1979): In 1979, a task force constituted by the Planning Commission for the 
purpose of poverty estimation, chaired by YK Alagh, constructed a poverty line for rural and 
urban areas on the basis of nutritional requirements.  
Lakdawala Committee (1993): In 1993, an expert group constituted to review methodology for 
poverty estimation, chaired by DT Lakdawala, made the following suggestions:  
1. Consumption expenditure should be calculated based on calorie consumption as earlier;  
2. State specific poverty lines should be constructed and these should be updated using the 
Consumer Price Index of Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) in urban areas and Consumer Price 
Index of Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL) in rural areas;  
3. Discontinuation of ‘scaling’ of poverty estimates based on National Accounts Statistics.  This 
assumes that the basket of goods and services used to calculate CPI-IW and CPI-AL reflect 
the consumption patterns of the poor.  
Tendulkar  Committee  (2009):  In  2005,  another expert  group to  review  methodology  for 
poverty estimation, chaired by Suresh Tendulkar, was constituted by the Planning Commission 
to address the following three shortcomings of the previous methods: (i) consumption patterns 
were linked to the 1973-74 poverty line baskets (PLBs) of goods and services, whereas there 
were significant changes in the consumption patterns of the poor since that time, which were 
not reflected in the poverty estimates; (ii) there were issues with the adjustment of prices for 
inflation, both spatially (across regions) and temporally (across time); and (iii) earlier poverty 
lines  assumed  that  health  and  education  would  be  provided  by  the  State  and  formulated 
poverty lines accordingly. 
It recommended four major changes:  
1. Using Mixed Reference Period (MRP) based estimates, as opposed to Uniform Reference 
Period (URP) based estimates that were used in earlier methods for estimating poverty. 
2. A uniform poverty line basket (PLB) across rural and urban India;  
3. A change  in  the  price  adjustment  procedure  to correct  spatial  and  temporal  issues  with 
price adjustment; and  
4. Incorporation of private expenditure on health and education while estimating poverty.   
It based its calculations on the consumption of the following items: cereal, pulses, milk, edible 
oil, non-vegetarian items, vegetables, fresh fruits, dry fruits, sugar, salt & spices, other food, 
intoxicants,  fuel,  clothing,  footwear,  education,  medical  (non-institutional  and  institutional), 
entertainment,  personal  &  toilet  goods,  other  goods,  other  services  and  durables.  The 
Committee computed new poverty lines for rural and urban areas of each state.  To  do  this,  it 
used data on value and quantity consumed of the items mentioned above by the population 
that was classified as poor by the previous urban poverty line.  It concluded that the all India 
poverty line was Rs 446.68 per capita per month in rural areas and Rs 578.80 per capita per 
month in urban areas in 2004-05.  
The  following  table  outlines  the  manner  in  which  the  percentage  of  population  below  the 
poverty line changed after the application of the Tendulkar Committee’s methodology.  
Committee Rural Urban Total 
Lakdawala Committee 28.3 25.7 27.5 
Tendulkar Committee 41.8 27.5 37.2 
Table: Percentage of population below poverty line calculated by the Lakadwala Committee 
and the Tendulkar Committee for the Year 2004-05 
The  Committee  also  recommended  a  new  method  of  updating  poverty  lines,  adjusting  for 
changes in prices and patterns of consumption, using the consumption basket of people close 
to  the  poverty  line.  Thus,  the  estimates  released  in  2009-10  and  2011-12  use  this  method 
instead of using indices derived from the CPI-AL for rural areas and CPI-IW for urban areas as

Rangarajan Committee: In 2012, the Planning Commission constituted a new expert panel on 
poverty estimation, chaired by C Rangarajan. The Rangarajan committee estimation is based on 
an independent large survey of households by Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). It 
has also used different methodology wherein a household is considered poor if it is unable to 
save.  
The methods also include certain normative levels of adequate nourishment, clothing, house 
rent, conveyance, education and also behavioral determination of non-food expenses. It also 
considered  average  requirements  of  calories,  protein  and  fats  based  on  ICMR  norms 
differentiated by age and gender. 
According to the report of the committee, the new poverty line was set at Rs 32 in rural areas 
and Rs 47 in urban areas. The earlier poverty line figure was Rs 27 for rural India and Rs 33 for 
Urban India (see following table).

Hashim  Committee- The  Hashim  Committee  in  its  2012  report  recommended  three  stage 
identification process to identify the families living Below Poverty Line in urban areas which 
include  automatic  exclusion,  automatic  inclusion  and  scoring  index  of  the  remaining  urban 
families  in  this  order.  The  methodology  recommended  mainly  emphasizes  on  capturing 
residential, social and occupational vulnerabilities. 
Saxena  Committee- Dr.  N.C.  Saxena  Committee  was  set  up  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural 
Development to advise it on the suitable methodology for BPL Census and not for estimation 
of poverty. However, in the Report submitted by the Expert Group on 21st August 2009 it was 
mentioned that the percentage of people entitled to BPL status should be revised upwards to at 
least 50%. 
1.4.	Multidimensional	Poverty	
“What use is equality before law if there is no equality in fact? Freedoms guaranteed by Article 
19 will become empty slogans for a person who has no food to eat, no roof under which he can 
take shelter and no clothes to wear; and what is the use of vote to a person who is hungry and 
kept illiterate and denied the knowledge required to participate in the affairs of the State?”  -  
Justice K. S. Hedge. 
The  above  quote drives  home  the  point  that  poverty  is  not  only  economic  hardship  but  it 
affects other  aspects  of  life  hampering  overall  growth  of  poor.    The  United  Nations  in  the 
Sustainable Development Goal 1, also, calls to eradicate poverty in all its forms everywhere. In 
this context, traditional poverty measures – often calculated by numbers of people who earn 
less than a certain income level – shed light on how little people earn but not on whether or 
how they experience poverty in their day-to-day lives.

Student Notes: The Multidimensional  Poverty  Index 
helps   answer   that   call,   providing 
immensely  valuable  information  for  all 
those  seeking  to  understand  what 
poverty looks like for a particular place 
or  group  of  people,  and  for  those 
working  on  the  policies  to  help  people 
escape poverty now and into the future.  
About Multidimensional Poverty Index 
• It  was  developed  in  2010  by  the 
Oxford   Poverty   and   Human 
Development  Initiative  (OPHI)  and 
the  United  Nations  Development 
Programme (UNDP). 
• The    global    Multidimensional 
Poverty   Index   (MPI)   is   an 
international  measure  of  acute 
multidimensional  poverty covering 
over 100 developing countries. 
• The  MPI  goes beyond income as the 
sole   indicator   for   poverty,   by 
exploring  the  ways  in  which  people 
experience  poverty  in  their health, 
education,  and  standard  of  living. It 
captures both  the  incidence  and 
intensity of poverty.  
o The  MPI  assesses poverty  at  the 
individual level.  
o If someone is deprived in three or 
more of ten (weighted) indicators, 
the global index identifies them as 
‘MPI  poor’,  and  the  extent – or 
intensity – of  their  poverty  is 
measured  by  the  percentage of 
deprivations they are 
experiencing. 
• The global MPI can be used to create a 
comprehensive  picture  of  people 
living  in  poverty,  and  permits 
comparisons  both  across  countries 
and  world  regions, and   within 
countries by ethnic group, urban/rural 
area,  subnational  region,  and  age 
group, as well as other key household 
and community characteristics. 
• It complements  the  international 
$1.90 a day poverty rate by showing the nature and extent of overlapping deprivations for 
each person. 
• The 2019  update  of  the  global MPI covers  101  countries—31  low  income,  68  middle 
income and 2 high income.

India specific Findings 
• Improvement 
o India lifted 271 million people out of poverty (down to 27.5 per cent from 54.7 per 
cent)  between  2006  and  2016,  recording  the  fastest  reductions  in  the 
multidimensional poverty index values during the period with strong improvements in 
areas such as “assets, cooking fuel, sanitation and nutrition. 
o India’s MPI value reduced from 0.283 in 2005-06 to 0.123 in 2015-16. 
o Among  the  four  Indian  states with  the  most  acute  MPI — Bihar,  Jharkhand,  Uttar 
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh — Jharkhand has made the most progress. 
o India reduced: 
ü deprivation in nutrition from 44.3% in 2005-06 to 21.2% in 2015-16, 
ü child mortality from 4.5% to 2.2%, 
ü people deprived of cooking fuel from 52.9% to 26.2%, 
ü deprivation in sanitation from 50.4% to 24.6%, 
ü deprivation of drinking water from 16.6% to 6.2 %, 
ü access to electricity as deprivation from 29.1% to 8.6%, 
ü housing from 44.9% to 23.6% 
o Overall,  India  was  among  three  countries  where poverty  reduction  in  rural  areas 
outpaced that in urban areas is an indicator of pro-poor development. 
Limitations of MPI 
• The  indicators may not reflect capabilities but  instead  reflect  outputs  (such  as  years  of 
schooling) or inputs (such as cooking fuel). 
• The health data are relatively weak and overlook some groups’ deprivations, especially for 
nutrition. 
• In some cases careful judgments were needed to address missing data. 
• Intra-household inequalities may be severe, but these could not be reflected. 
• MPI goes well beyond a headcount ratio to include the intensity of poverty, it does not 
measure inequality among the poor, although decompositions by groups can be used to 
reveal group-based inequalities. 
• Estimates presented are based on publicly available data and cover various years between 
2007 and 2018, which limits direct cross-country comparability. 
1.5.	What	Causes	Poverty	
Economic Reasons 
• Widespread unemployment and lack of gainful employment 
• Lack of resources and wealth and inequality in wealth distribution  
• Relatively lower rate of growth of income as compared to inflation 
• Lack of capital and skill leading to a vicious circle of poverty 
• Lower Per Capital Income 
• Lack of professional and technical education and inadequate growth of industries 
• Lower productivity in agriculture and industries 
• Low level of wage rates 
• Agriculture being over-burdened due to lack of alternative employment 
Historical Reasons 
• Exploitative colonial rule destroyed local industries i.e. de-industrialization and turned India 
into exporter of raw materials and imported of finished goods 
• Destruction of rural and urban handicrafts and small scale industries 
• Drain of Wealth by colonial government

1.6.	Policies	and	Programmes	Aimed	At	Poverty	Alleviation	
The Indian Constitution and five year plans state social justice as the primary objective of the 
developmental strategies of the government. 
The government’s approach to poverty reduction is of three dimensions. The first one is growth 
oriented approach. It is based on the expectation that the effects of economic growth — rapid 
increase in gross domestic product and per capita income — would spread to all sections of 
society and will trickle down to the poor sections also. This was the major focus of planning in 
the  1950s  and  early  1960s.  However,  this  approach  could  not  produce  desired  outcome. 
Economists state that the benefits of economic growth have not trickled down to the poor.  
The second  approach is  based  on  the creation  of  additional  assets  by  means  of  work 
generation.  This  approach  has  been  initiated  from  the  Third  Five  Year  Plan  (1961-66)  and 
progressively enlarged since then. One of the noted programmes initiated in the 1970s was 
Food for Work. 
Examples of self-employment programmes are  
• Rural Employment Generation Programme (REGP)  
• Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana (PMRY)  
• Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY)  
These  programs  aim  at  providing  financial  help  to  create  self-employment  opportunities  for 
unemployed. Additionally, SJSRY also aims at creating wage employment. 
• Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) - Earlier, under self-employment programmes, 
financial assistance was given to families or individuals. Since the 1990s, this approach has 
been changed. Now those who wish to benefit from these programmes are encouraged to 
form self-help groups (SHGs). Initially they are encouraged to save some money and lend 
among themselves as small loans. Later, through banks, the government provides partial 
financial assistance to SHGs which then decide whom the loan is to be given to for self-
employment activities. This has now been restructured as Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- 
National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM).  A  similar  programme  called Deendayal 
Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) has also been in place 
for urban poor. 
• Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act- This has been termed as the 
biggest scheme for poverty alleviation. In August 2005, the Parliament passed this Act to

Student Notes: 
provide guaranteed wage employment to every rural household whose adult volunteer is to 
do unskilled manual work for a minimum of 100 days in a year.  
• PM Kisan NIdhi Scheme- As it uses direct income support (DIS), it marks the beginning of a 
new  policy  direction.  It  can  reach  about  86  per  cent  of  farm  families  compared  to  loan 
waivers that can benefit a maximum of 30 per cent of the peasantry and higher MSP policy 
which can benefit a maximum of 10-15 per cent of peasantry. 
The third approach to addressing poverty is to provide minimum basic amenities to the people. 
This has been sought to achieve through provision of food grains at subsidised rates, education, 
health,  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Programmes  under  this  approach  are  expected  to 
supplement the consumption of the poor, create employment opportunities and bring about 
improvements in health and education. One can trace this approach from the Fifth Five Year 
Plan- “even  with  expanded  employment  opportunities,  the  poor  will  not  be  able  to  buy  for 
themselves all the essential goods and services. They have to be supplemented up to at least 
certain minimum standards by social consumption and investment in the form of essential food 
grains, education, health, nutrition, drinking water, housing, communications and electricity.”  
Three major programmes that aim at improving the food and nutritional status of the poor are 
Public Distribution System, Integrated Child Development Scheme and Midday Meal Scheme. 
Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana,  Pradhan  Mantri  Gramodaya  Yojana,  Valmiki  Ambedkar 
Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana are also attempts in developing infrastructure and 
housing conditions. 
The government also has a variety of other social security programmes to help a few specific 
groups. National Social Assistance Programme is one such programme initiated by the central 
government. Under this programme, elderly people who do not have anyone to take care of 
them are given pension to sustain themselves. Poor women who are destitute and widows are 
also covered under this scheme. The government has also introduced a few schemes to provide 
health insurance to poor people. From 2014, a scheme called Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana 
is available in which are encouraged to open bank accounts. Besides promoting savings habit, 
this  scheme  intends  to  transfer  all  the  benefits  of  government  schemes  and  subsidies  to 
account  holders  directly.  Each  bank  account  holder  is  also  entitled  to  Rs.  1  lakh  accident 
insurance and Rs. 30,000 life insurance cover. 
1.7.	Poverty	Alleviation	Programmes-	A	Critical	Assessment	
Identifying the multidimensional nature of poverty, various schemes are being implemented to 
address various facets of poverty. These schemes have given some good results as can be seen 
from following figures- 
• The number of poor facing multidimensional poverty in India has nearly halved from 54.7% 
in 2005-06 to 27.5% in 2015-16. 
• The ratio of poverty in India as per Tendulkar Committee stood at 21.9 % in 2011-12. 
• The percentage of absolute poor in some states is well below the national average. 
• There is improvement in terms of per capita income and average standard of living 
• Housing has been provided to a sizeable population under various housing schemes. 
However, despite various strategies to alleviate poverty, hunger, malnourishment, illiteracy and 
lack of basic amenities continue to be a common feature in many parts of India. Though the 
poverty  alleviation  programs  have  evolved  progressively  since  independence  but  no  radical 
change is observed in their character. None resulted in any radical change in the ownership of 
assets, process of production and improvement of basic amenities to the needy.  
Major areas of concern which prevent successful implementation of these programs are- 
• Unequal  distribution  of  land  and  other  assets,  due  to  which  the  benefits  from  direct 
poverty alleviation programmes are appropriated by the non-poor.

Student Notes: 
• Compared  to  the  magnitude  of  poverty,  the  amount  of  resources  allocated  for  these 
programmes is not sufficient.  
• These  programmes  depend  mainly  on  government  and  bank  officials  for  their 
implementation.  Since  such  officials  are  ill  motivated,  inadequately  trained,  corruption 
prone  and  vulnerable  to  pressure  from  a  variety  of  local  elites,  the  resources  are 
inefficiently used and wasted.  
• There is also non-participation of local level institutions in programme implementation. 
• High growth alone is not sufficient to reduce poverty. Without the active participation of 
the poor, successful implementation of any programme is not possible.  
• Government  policies  also  have  proved  inadequate  to  address  the  vast  majority  of 
vulnerable people who are living on or just above the poverty line.  
1.8.	Way	Forward	
The government should work towards effective implementation of various ongoing programs 
by- 
• Sufficient allocation of resources 
• Providing adequate training and incentives to government and bank officials implementing 
these programs 
• Ensuring participation of local government and institutions  
• Ensuring active participation of poor in these programs 
• Effective distribution of wealth and benefits of economic growth 
It has also been realized that poverty can effectively be eradicated only when the poor start 
contributing  to  growth  by  their  active  involvement  in  the  growth  process.  This  is  possible 
through a process of social mobilisation, encouraging poor people to participate and get them 
empowered. This will also help create employment opportunities which may lead to increase in 
levels of income, skill development, health and literacy. Moreover, it is necessary to identify 
poverty  stricken  areas  and  provide  infrastructure  such  as  schools,  roads,  power, telecom,  IT 
services, training institutions etc. 
1.9.	Poverty:	Last	One	Decade	
One of the great achievements in recent decades has been the huge reduction in the numbers 
of people living in extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as $1.90 per person per day. 
India has been able to lift 270 million people out of poverty facing multidimensional poverty, 
thus reducing its poor population by nearly half. Yet new evidence from the World Bank shows 
that the rate of poverty reduction has halved since 2013. Extreme poverty is actually increasing 
in sub-Saharan Africa. This new evidence also shows that much of humanity has barely escaped 
poverty, with just under half the world’s population – 3.4 billion people – subsisting on less than 
$5.50 a day, which is the World Bank’s new poverty line for extreme poverty in upper-middle-
income  countries.  The  Bank  finds  that  women  are  more  often  among  the  poorest  people, 
particularly during their reproductive years, because of the level of unpaid care work they are 
expected  to  do.  This  is  a  direct  result  of  inequality,  and  of  prosperity  accruing 
disproportionately to those at the top for decades. 
1.9.1.	Nobel	Prize	in	Economics	
Indian-American economist Abhijit Banerjee has won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, along 
with Esther Duflo of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Kremer of Harvard 
University “for  their  experimental  approach  to  alleviating  global  poverty.” Their  new 
experiment-based  approach- called Randomised  Control  Trials  (RCTs) has  transformed 
development economics.

Student Notes: 
Is there a flip side to RCTs? 
• Randomly  assigning  people  or  households  makes  it 
likely that   the   groups   are   equivalent,   but 
randomisation “cannot guarantee” it. 
• So, one group may perform differently from the other, 
not because of the “treatment” that it has been given, 
but  because  it  has  more  women  or  more  educated 
people in it. 
• Also, RCTs do not guarantee if something that worked 
in Kerala will work in Bihar, or if something that worked 
for a small group will also work at large scale. 
What are Randomised Control Trials? 
• RCTs break larger questions about policy interventions into smaller, easier to test studies.  
• For example, the big questions like ‘poverty’ are broken down into its various dimensions 
like- poor health, inadequate education, etc. 
• Within poor health, they look at nutrition, provisioning of medicines, and vaccination, etc. 
Within  vaccinations,  they  try  to  conduct  various  experiments  and,  based  on  such 
“evidence”, decide what needs to be done. 
• This  is  extremely  relevant  when  it  comes  to  framing  policy  in  low- and  middle-income 
countries, where state capacity is quite limited and it is particularly necessary to be able to 
prioritise more effective policies over less. 
How RCTs Work? 
• For  instance,  if  one  wanted  to  understand  whether  providing  a  mobile  vaccination van 
and/or a sack of grains would incentivise villagers to vaccinate their kids, then under an 
RCT, village households would be divided into four groups A, B, C and D. 
o Group A would be provided 
with  a  mobile  vaccination 
van facility,  
o Group  B  would  be  given  a 
sack of food grains, 
o Group  C  would  get  both, 
and 
o Group D would get neither. 
• Households would be chosen at 
random to ensure there was no 
bias, the groups are equal, and 
that any difference in vaccination levels was essentially because of the “intervention”. 
• Group D is called the “control” group while others are called “treatment” groups. 
• Such an experiment would not only show whether a policy initiative works, but would also 
provide a measure of the difference it brings about. 
• It would also show what happens when more than one initiatives are combined. This would 
help policymakers to have the evidence before they choose a policy.  
Some studies using RCTs 
• On vaccination: 
o Problem:  Low  service  quality  one  reason  why  poor  families  invest  so  little  in  preventive 
measures. For example, the staff at the health centres that are responsible for vaccinations are 
often absent from work. 
o  Solution: Mobile vaccination clinics, where the care staff were always on site – could fix this 
problem. Vaccination rates tripled in the villages that were randomly selected to have access to 
these clinics, at 18 per cent compared to 6 per cent. 
o This increased further, to 39 per cent, if families received a bag of lentils as a bonus when they 
vaccinated their children. 
o Because the mobile clinic had a low level of fixed costs, the total cost per vaccination actually 
halved, despite the additional expense of the lentils. 
• On education: 
o Problem: In many poor country’s schools, curricula and teaching do not correspond to pupils’ 
needs.  There  is  a  high  level  of  absenteeism  among  teachers  and  educational  institutions  are 
generally weak. 
o Solutions: Reason for high level of absenteeism was lack of clear incentives and accountability 
for teachers. One way of boosting the teachers’ motivation was to employ them on short-term 
contracts that could be extended if they had good results. 
o Experiments found that pupils who had teachers on short-term contracts had significantly better 
test results, but that having fewer pupils per permanently employed teacher had no significant 
effects.

Student Notes: 
o Studies suggested that additional resources are, of limited value whereas, targeted support for 
weak pupils had strong positive effects, even in the medium term. 
• On health subsidy: 
o Question: Whether medicine and healthcare should be charged for and, if so, what they should 
cost? 
o Experiment: A  field  experiment  showed  how  the  demand  for  deworming  pills  for  parasitic 
infections was affected by price. They found that 75 per cent of parents gave their children these 
pills when the medicine was free, compared to 18 per cent when they cost less than a US dollar, 
which is still heavily subsidised. 
o  Inference: Poor  people  are  extremely  price-sensitive  regarding  investments  in  preventive 
healthcare. 
2.	Inequality		
“You  need  some  inequality  to  grow...  but  extreme  inequality  is  not  only  useless  but  can  be 
harmful  to  growth  because  it  reduces  mobility  and  can  lead  to  political  capture  of  our 
democratic institutions.” – Thomas Piketty.  
The above quote points towards the perils of rising inequality which as per various reports is on 
an upward trajectory worldwide. There is widespread concern that economic growth has not 
been fairly shared, and that the economic crisis has only widened the gap between rich and 
poor. Similar concerns were voiced by former US President Barack Obama in 2013 when he 
termed inequality as ‘the defining challenge of our time’.  
2.1.	What	is	inequality?	
The  Cambridge  dictionary describes  inequality as  “the  unfair  situation  in  society  when  some 
people have more opportunities, etc. than other people”. The United  Nations  describes it as 
“the  state  of  not  being  equal,  especially  in  status,  rights  and  opportunities”.  
While the term itself is quite vast and has various interpretations, here, we are concerned with 
“economic inequality” and its relationship with poverty. Economic inequality generally refers 
to  the  disparity  of  wealth  or  income  between  different  groups  or  within  a  society.  Often 
characterized by the aphorism “the rich get richer while the poor get poorer,” the phrase often 
refers  more  specifically  to the  gap  in  income  or  assets  between  the  poorest  and  richest 
segments of an individual nation. 
Income inequality is  the  inequality  in  and  disparity  in  the  incomes  commanded  by  the  top 
percentile of the population in comparison to the bottom percentiles, while wealth inequality 
measures look to do the same but by calculating disparities in wealth instead of income. 
Economic inequality is used to measure relative poverty with the help of Lorenz curve. 
2.2.	Significance	of	Economic	Inequality	
Even though the basic concept of inequality has entered the public consciousness, the effects of 
highly concentrated wealth are hotly debated and poorly understood by observers. Research 
attributes advantages and disadvantages to pronounced levels of economic inequality. Global 
trends have led to an increasing concentration of wealth in an increasingly small number of 
hands.  Some  economists  conclude  inequality  is  beneficial  overall  for stimulating  growth, 
improves the quality of life for all members of a society, or is merely a necessary part of social 
progress.  Other  economists  claim  wealth  concentrations  create  perpetually  oppressed 
minorities, exploit disadvantaged populations, hinder economic growth, and lead to numerous 
social problems.

2.3.	Measuring	Economic	Inequality	
Ø Indices 
A. Gini Coefficient/ Gini Index 
Gini  coefficient  is  the  most 
widely   used   measure   of 
inequality. It is based on Lorenz 
curve.   The   Lorenz   curve 
plots percentiles     of     the 
population  on  the  horizontal 
axis     and     corresponding 
cumulative income or wealth on 
the vertical axis.  
The   Lorenz   curve   is   often 
accompanied   by   a   straight 
diagonal  line  with  a  slope  of  1, 
which    represents    perfect 
equality  in  income  or  wealth 
distribution;  the  Lorenz  curve  lies  beneath  it,  showing  the  actual  distribution. Gini 
coefficient  is  the  area  between  the  straight  line and  the  curved  line  which  is 
expressed as a ratio of the area under the straight line. A coefficient of 1 means that 
one person earns all of the income or holds all of the wealth, while zero represents that 
everyone has the same income, i.e. perfect equality. 
World  Bank  data  reveals  that  inequality  in  India  is  on  the  rise  with  all-India  Gini 
coefficient  increasing  from  0.30  in  1983  to  0.36  in  2011-12.  As  per  United  Nations, 
the Gini coefficient of income inequality for India fell from 0.36 in 2010 to 0.33 in 2015. 
Shortcomings of Gini Coefficients 
Though  useful  for  analyzing  economic  inequality,  the  Gini  coefficient  has  some 
shortcomings. Its main limitation is that it is not easily decomposable or additive. Also, 
it does not respond in the same way to income transfers between people in opposite 
tails of the income distribution as it does to transfers in the middle of the distribution. 
Furthermore, very different income distributions can present the same Gini coefficient. 
It  also does  not  show  demographic  variations among  subgroups  within  the 
distribution, such as the distribution of incomes across age, race, or social groups. In 
that  vein, understanding  demographics can  be  important  for  understanding  what  a 
given  Gini  coefficient  represents.  For  example,  a  large retired  population  pushes  the 
Gini higher.  
Also,  the  metric's  accuracy  is  dependent  on reliable GDP and income data. Shadow 
economies  and  informal  economic  activity  are  present  in  every  country. Informal 
economic activity tends to represent a larger portion of true economic production in 
developing countries and at the lower end of the income distribution within countries. 
In both cases this means that the Gini index of measured incomes will overstate true 
income  inequality.  Accurate  wealth  data  is  even  more  difficult  to  come  by  due  to 
the popularity of tax havens.

Student Notes: 
This  is  the  most  popular 
welfare-based   measure   of 
inequality.  It  presents  the 
percentage  of total  income 
that  a  given  society  would 
have to  forego in  order  to 
have  more  equal  shares  of 
income  between  its  citizens. 
This  measure  depends  on  the 
degree  of  society  aversion  to 
inequality    (a    theoretical 
parameter  decided  by  the 
researcher), where  a  higher 
value  entails  greater  social 
utility   or   willingness   by 
individuals  to  accept  smaller 
incomes  in  exchange  for  a 
more  equal  distribution.  An 
important   feature   of   the 
Atkinson index is that it can be 
decomposed  into  within  and 
between-group     inequality. 
Moreover, unlike other indices, 
it    can    provide welfare 
implications   of   alternative 
policies   and   allows   the 
researcher  to  include  some 
normative   content   to   the 
analysis 
C. Hoover  index  (also  known  as 
the Robin Hood index, Schutz 
index or Pietra ratio)  
It  shows  the  proportion  of  all 
income  which  would have  to 
be  redistributed  to  achieve  a 
state of perfect equality. In other words, the value of the index approximates the share 
of total income that has to be transferred from households above the mean to those 
below  the  mean  to  achieve  equality  in  the  distribution  of  incomes.  Higher  values 
indicate  more  inequality  and  that  more  redistribution  is  needed  to  achieve  income 
equality. It can be graphically represented as the maximum vertical distance between 
the Lorenz curve and the 45-degree line that represents perfect equality of incomes. 
D. Theil index and General Entropy (GE) measures  
The values of the GE class of measures vary between zero (perfect equality) and infinity 
(or  one,  if  normalized).  A  key  feature  of  these  measures  is  that  they  are  fully 
decomposable,  i.e.  inequality  may  be  broken  down  by  population  groups  or  income 
sources or using other dimensions, which can prove useful to policy makers. Another 
key  feature  is  that  researchers  can  choose  a  parameter  α  that  assigns  a  weight  to 
distances  between  incomes  in  different  parts  of  the  income  distribution.  For  lower 
values  of  α,  the  measure  is  more  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  lower  tail  of  the 
distribution and, for higher values, it is more sensitive to changes that affect the upper 
tail.  The  most  common values  for  α  are  0,  1,  and  2.  When  α=0,  the  index  is  called

“Theil’s L” or the “mean log deviation” measure. When α=1, the index is called “Theil’s 
T” index or, more commonly, “Theil index”. When α=2, the index is called “coefficient of 
variation”.  Similarly  to  the  Gini  coefficient,  when  income  redistribution  happens, 
change  in  the  indices  depends  on  the  level  of  individual  incomes  involved  in  the 
redistribution and the population size. 
Ø Ratios 
Ratios constitute the most basic inequality measures available. They are simple, direct, easy 
to understand, and they offer few data and computation challenges. Accordingly, they do 
not provide as much information as the complex measures described above. 
A. Decile dispersion ratio (or inter-decile ratio)  
It is the ratio of the average income of the richest x per cent of the population to the 
average income of the poorest x per cent. It expresses the income (or income share) of 
the rich as a multiple of that of the poor. However, it is vulnerable to extreme values 
and outliers. Common decile ratios include: D9/D1: ratio of the income of the 10 per 
cent richest to that of the 10 per cent poorest; D9/D5: ratio of the income of the 10 per 
cent richest to the income of those at the median of the earnings distribution; D5/ D1: 
ratio of the income of those at the median of the earnings distribution to the 10 per 
cent  poorest.  The  Palma  ratio  and  the  20/20  ratio  are  other  examples  of  decile 
dispersion ratios. 
B. Palma Ratio 
The Gini coefficient doesn't capture very explicitly changes in the top 10% - which has 
become the focus of much inequality research in the past 10 years - or the bottom 40%, 
where most poverty lies.  Palma ratio is the ratio of national income shares of the top 
10  per  cent  of  households  to  the  bottom  40  per  cent.  If  the  richest  10%  of  the 
population has five times the income of the bottom 40%, a country's Palma ratio is 5. 
The Palma ratio has been listed in the OECD rankings of countries' inequality, and in 
annual UN Human Development reports, alongside the Gini. 
C. 20/20 Ratio  
It compares the ratio of the average income of the richest 20 per cent of the population 
to the average income of the poorest 20 per cent of the population. Used by the United 
Nations Development Programme Human Development Report (called “income quintile 
ratio”).   
2.4.	Rising	Inequality?		
Oxfam 2019 report titled- “Public Good or Private Wealth?” provides following data about the 
inequality existing in India- 
• 1%- The top 10% of the Indian population holds 77% of the total national wealth. 73% of 
the  wealth  generated  in  2017  went  to  the  richest  1%,  while  67  million  Indians  who 
comprise the poorest half of the population saw only a 1% increase in their wealth. 
• 70- There are 119 billionaires in India. Their number has increased from only 9 in 2000 to 
101 in 2017. Between 2018 and 2022, India is estimated to produce 70 new millionaires 
every day. 
• 10x- Billionaires'  fortunes increased  by  almost  10  times  over  a  decade and their  total 
wealth is higher than the entire Union budget of India for the fiscal year 2018-19, which 
was at INR 24422 billion. 
• 63 M- Many ordinary Indians are not able to access the health care they need. 63 million of 
them are pushed into poverty because of healthcare costs every year - almost two people 
every second.

• 941 years- It would take 941 years for a minimum wage worker in rural India to earn what 
the top paid executive at a leading Indian garment company earns in a year. 
Inequality in World 
• According to Oxfam’s report- 
o In 2018, world’s 26 people owned the same wealth as the poorest 50% i.e. 3.8 billion 
people.  
o In the 10 years since the financial crisis, the number of billionaires has nearly doubled. 
o Between 2017 and 2018 a new billionaire was created every two days. 
o The world’s richest man, Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon, saw his fortune increase to 
$112bn. Just 1% of his fortune is equivalent to the whole health budget for Ethiopia, a 
country of 105 million people. 
• The World Inequality Report 2018 showed that between 1980 and 2016 the poorest 50% of 
humanity only captured 12 cents in every dollar of global income growth. By contrast, the 
top 1% captured 27 cents of every dollar. 
Thus the inequality is on an increasing trend in the world as well as in India. 
2.5.	Causes	of	Inequality	
Some economists suggest following reasons for the widening inequality in India- 
A. Inequitable and Uneven Distribution of Economic Growth 
• India's  economy  continues  to  grow  with  its  GDP  rising  faster  than  most nations  but 
people living at the bottom 10% are characterized by low wages; long working hours; 
lack of basic services such as first aid, drinking water and sanitation. 
• Phenomenon of billionaire boom is a symptom of failing economic system where those 
who are working hard, growing food for the country, building infrastructure, working in 
factories  are  struggling  to  fund  their  child’s  education,  buy  medicines  for  family 
members and manage two meals a day. 
B. Oxfam report 2019 puts the blame for increasing inequality on biased economic framework 
towards rich, where 
• Top  rates  of  tax  on  the  wealthiest  people  and  corporations  are  lower  than  they  have 
been for decades.  
• Unprecedented levels of tax avoidance and evasion ensure that the super-rich pay even 
less. 
C. Urban- Rural Inequality 
• India’s  badly  shaped  agricultural  and  rural  safety  nets. Per  capita  food  production  is 
going down. Rural infrastructure such as power, road transport facilities are in a poor 
state. 
• Rural job scheme and public distribution system performing far below their potential. 
This has added to the suffering of rural India while market forces are acting in favour of 
urban India, which is why it is progressing at a faster rate." 
2.6.	Inequality,	Poverty	and	Economic	Growth	
Economic growth and inequality play a major role in generating changes in poverty. High and 
sustained growth is essential for poverty reduction if the distribution of income remains more 
or  less  constant.  Likewise,  greater  inequality  tends  to  increase  relative  poverty.  For  these 
reasons, rise in growth has not led to commensurate reduction in poverty in countries where 
income inequality has been rising.

Student Notes: 
The  relationship  between  growth 
and  inequality  has  long  been  an 
important question for economists, 
and   a   number   of   influential 
theories  have  emerged  over  the 
years.  But  for  most  people,  the 
issue  boils  down  to  this:  is  rising 
inequality good or bad for growth? 
Those  who  believe  it’s  good,  or  at 
least   necessary,   argue   that   it 
provides incentives to 
entrepreneurs  and  a  source  of 
overall investment for the economy. 
Those  who  believe  it’s  bad  argue  that  it  can  prevent  poorer  people  from  investing  in  their 
education and encourage the rich to grab a bigger slice of the economic pie without making the 
pie any bigger. 
Kuznets  curve  provides  a  way  to  study  the  relationship  between  inequality  and  economic 
growth. It says that as the economy grows, inequality increases in the beginning and then it 
decreases with further growth in economy.  
As per Kuznets hypothesis, as economic growth comes from the creation of better products, it 
usually  boosts  the  income  of  workers  and  investors  who  participate  in  the  first  wave  of 
innovation. The industrialisation of an agrarian economy is a common example. This inequality, 
however, tends to be temporary as workers and investors who were initially left behind soon 
catch up by helping offer either the same or better products. This improves their incomes.   
Inequality is good for the Growth 
• Drives growth by allowing entrepreneurs – like Apple’s Steve Jobs or HTC’s Cher Wang – to 
enjoy the rewards of their risk-taking. 
• Light  tax  and  relatively  little  distribution  allow  people  to  accumulate  wealth  becoming 
sources for investment for the economy. 
Inequality is bad for Growth 
• A widening wealth gap leads low-earning families to invest less in education and skills. This 
probably hurts growth by reducing the number of skilled – and more highly productive – 
workers available for hire in the economy 
• In OECD countries, the average increase in inequality of 3 Gini points over the past couple 
of decades is estimated to have cut GDP by around 8.5%. 
2.6.2.	Inequality	and	Poverty	
The  continued  accumulation  of  wealth  by  the  very  richest  in our  societies,  while  most  of 
humanity subsists on barely anything, is extremely detrimental. Relative poverty has in present 
times been recognized as growing inequality and the main form of poverty in industrialized 
countries.  Also,  inequality  affects  the rate  of  economic  growth  which  is  very  important  for 
poverty reduction.  
Even,  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals  recognizes  the  role  of  inequality  in 
making  the  fight  to  end  poverty  much  harder.  Goal  10  of  SDG  talks  about  “Reduced 
Inequalities” which can be achieved by equitable and just distribution of benefits of economic 
growth  to  the  poorest  people. As per the World Bank, unless growth benefits the poorest 
people  more  between  now  and  2030,  the  first  Sustainable  Development  Goal  (SDG) – to 
eliminate extreme poverty – will be missed. Thus, inequality affects poverty both- directly and 
indirectly.

Student Notes: 
Other Impacts of Inequality 
• The  growing  income  inequality  in  India  has  negatively  impacted  poor  citizens'  access 
to education and healthcare.  
• Rising income inequality makes it difficult for the poor to climb up the economic ladder and 
increases their risk of being victims to poverty trap.   
• Worldwide, the human cost of inequality is devastating. Today: 
o 262 million children will not be allowed to go to school.  
o Almost 10,000 people will die because they cannot access healthcare. 
o 4 billion hours of unpaid care work will be done, the majority by women in poverty. 
• Inequality  is  destabilizing.  For  instance,  in  recent  years  we  have  seen  a  rise  in 
authoritarianism by governments worldwide, with crackdowns on freedom of speech and 
democracy. We have also seen a rise in popularity for right-wing, racist, sexist views and 
authoritarian politicians who support them. Many have pointed to the link between this 
global trend and high levels of inequality. 
• Inequality undermines our societies. It is bad for everyone, not just the poorest people. In 
more  unequal  countries,  trust  is  lower  and  crime  higher.  Unequal  societies  are  more 
stressed, less happy and have poorer mental health. 
• Inequality makes the fight to save our planet from climate breakdown even harder. Oxfam 
has shown that the average carbon footprint of the richest 1% globally could be as much as 
175 times higher than that of the bottom 10%. 
2.7.	Role	of	Government	in	Reducing	Inequality	
Current crisis of inequality is the direct result of the moral failure of present governance and 
market system which allows few persons to accumulate extreme wealth while masses languish 
in poverty. Such exclusive, highly unequal society may seem sturdy and inevitable in short term, 
but eventually it will collapse. Eventually the pitchforks will come out, and the ensuing chaos 
will not benefit anyone – not the wealthy people, and not the poorest people who have already 
been left behind. To avert this existential crisis, steps must be taken to not reward greed at the 
expense of future. The present system must be replaced with a new economic framework – 
what Oxfam has called a more ‘Human Economy’,  which  recognizes  that  justice and inclusion 
are not the result of economic prosperity, but rather the cause of economic prosperity. 
Governments face a stark choice today – a choice between a life of dignity for all their citizens 
or continued extreme wealth for a tiny few. The lesson is clear: to beat poverty, we must fight 
inequality.   
2.8.	Steps	Taken	to	Tackle	Income	Inequality	
• Government of India has taken various steps to reduce income inequality- 
o Progressive taxation policy which taxes the rich more. 
o Land reforms and redistribution of surplus land after independence. 
o Various  social  security  measures  such  as  pensions,  subsidized  foodgrains  through  PDS 
etc. 
o Introduction of the three pronged Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile programmes aimed at a 
comprehensive strategy of inclusion, financial empowerment and social security. 
o Minimum wage rates have been revised upwards from time to time. 
o Provision of free of cost education and health services, however, these services need 
significant improvement. 
• Beyond extreme poverty: A focus on the bottom 40: Sustainable Development Goal 10 
presents to the international community the following task: ensure that the income growth 
of the bottom 40% of their population is higher than the national average by the year 2030. 
• The World Bank in 2013 introduced shared prosperity, defined as the growth in the average 
income or consumption of the poorest 40 percent of the distribution in the population, as 
one of the twin goals, along with ending extreme poverty.

2.9.	Way	Forward	
Specifically, policy measures in three areas will be critical:  
• Inclusive growth and the expansion of productive employment. 
• Redistribution of incomes and assets. 
• Pro-poor macro-economic policies. 
Oxfam has given following recommendations to reduce Income Inequality in India-  
• Address the needs of the underfunded social sector in India. More public resources should 
be  mobilised  for  providing  basic  essential  services  like  health  and  education,  social 
protection, etc. to reach out to the poor and excluded. The affirmative policy interventions 
like  Gender  Budgeting,  Scheduled  Caste  Sub  Plan,  Tribal  Sub  Plan,  etc.  must  be 
implemented properly. 
• Promote inclusive growth by  encouraging  labour-intensive  sectors  that  will  create  more 
jobs; investing in agriculture; and effectively implementing the social protection schemes 
that exist. 
• In  taxation,  the  focus  should  be  more  on generating revenue from direct taxes.  Ensure 
proper  mobilisation  of  property  &  wealth  taxes.  Rationalize  corporate  tax  exemptions/ 
incentives.  
• Scrutinise the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime from the perspective of the poor. 
The rates for different commodities should be such that they do not place an unfair burden 
of taxes on the poor households.  
• It also sought sealing of the “leaking wealth bucket" by taking stringent measures against 
tax evasion and avoidance, imposing higher tax on super-rich and removing corporate tax 
breaks.

Student Notes: 
Answer: 
Universal  Basic  Income  is  a  radical  and  compelling  paradigm  shift  to  ensure  social 
justice along with a productive economy. It is premised on the idea that a just society 
needs to guarantee to each individual a minimum income which provides the necessary 
material foundation for a life with access to basic goods and a life of dignity.  
Potent tool to reduce leakages and reduce inequality 
• Direct transfer: UBI reduces out of system leakage because transfers are directed 
straight to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts.  
• Reduced  opportunities:  The  scope  for  diversion  is  reduced  considerably,  since 
discretionary powers of authorities are eliminated almost wholly. 
• Increased accountability: Furthermore, UBI’s expanded coverage will likely impact 
out of system leakage since the state is answerable to a larger section of its citizens. 
• Better monitoring: Finally, given the fewer avenues for leakages, monitoring a UBI 
would be easier than many other schemes. 
UBI has immense potential to reduce inequality by way of direct and indirect effects.  
• Direct effects include: redistribution of wealth, creating flexibility in labour market, 
enhancing productivity, positively affecting education. 
• Indirect  longer-term  effects include:  increased  entrepreneurship  and  large 
multiplier  effects,  increased  number  choices  for  education  and  enhanced 
participation  in  democracy.  All  these  will  lead  to  even  greater  reduction  in 
inequality than might be immediately apparent.  
Challenges in its implementation 
• Given  the  current  status  of  financial  access  among  the  poor,  a  UBI  may  put  too 
much stress on the banking system 
• Gender disparity induced by cash- Gender norms may regulate the sharing of UBI 
within a household – men are likely to exercise control over spending of the UBI. 
This may not always be the case with other in-kind transfers. 
• Fiscal  cost  given  political  economy  of  exit -Once  introduced,  it  may  become 
difficult for the government to wind up a UBI in case of failure. 
• Opposition  may  arise  from  the  provision  of  the transfer to rich individuals as  it 
might seem to trump the idea of equity and state welfare for the poor. 
• Exposure to market risks (cash vs. food)- Unlike food subsidies that are not subject 
to fluctuating market prices, a cash transfer’s purchasing power may severely be 
curtailed by market fluctuations 
• Moral Hazard- A minimum guaranteed income might make people lazy and opt out 
of the labour market. 
In  spite  of  various  challenges,  implementing  UBI  in  India  is  desirable  due  to  high 
inequality,  weaknesses  in  existing  welfare  schemes  (which  are  riddled  with 
misallocation, exclusions and leakages) and fast progress in JAM scheme. Moreover UBI 
stands  greater  chance  in  a  developing  country  like  India,  where  it  can  be  pegged  at 
relatively low levels of income but still yield immense welfare gains.

• Mention the different figures arrived at by Rangarajan and Tendulkar methodology. 
• Then the answer should discuss the lack of consensus among scholars as to the 
efficacy of various methods and criteria to measure poverty estimates.  
• The second part has to discuss the rise or fall of poverty with economic growth 
since the dawn of economic reforms. This part should end with an assessment with 
supportive argument. 
Answer: 
Poverty is a state of deprivation, in which some people are not able to meet their basic 
needs.  For  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  poverty  alleviation  programs,  we  need  to 
measure the extent of poverty, which is done using a poverty line. In India, Poverty line 
was  determined  by  erstwhile  Planning  Commission  based  on  consumption  data 
provided  by  NSSO.  However,  what  constitutes  the  representative  basket  of 
consumption is debatable and is decided differently by different committees. The two 
most  common  parameters  are  income  and  energy  requirement  for  meeting  basic 
demands. 
Rangarajan Methodology: the latest It used the following parameters: 
• ‘Monthly expenditure of a Household of five’, such as house rent, electricity etc.  
• Certain  normative  levels  of  ‘adequate  nourishment’  plus  clothing,  house  rent, 
conveyance, education.  
• Behaviorally determined level of other non-food expenses. 
• For the first time, apart from calorie, it also considered fats and proteins as part of 
normative nutrition.  
Based on these, it fixed Rs. 972 in rural and Rs. 1407 in urban areas as poverty line. 
Accordingly,  the  all-India  poverty  ratio  was  29.5%  and  38.2%,  in  2011-12  and  2009-
2010,  respectively.  This was  quite  high  than  21.9%  and  29.8%  as  estimated  by  the 
Tendulkar  Committee  methodology  for  the  corresponding  periods.  These  contrasting 
estimates were due to different methodologies adopted. 
Impact of economic reform on poverty:  
There are two conclusions on trends in poverty: 
• Poverty declined by 1.3 percentage points per annum after 1991, compared to that 
of  0.44  percentage  points  per  annum  prior  to  1991.  Among  other  things,  urban 
growth is the most important contributor to the rapid reduction in poverty in the 
post-reform period. 
• In the post-reform period, poverty declined faster in the 2000s than in the 1990s.  
According to Tendulkar committee, around 138 million people were lifted above the 
poverty  line  during  2004  to  2009  alone.  Rangarajan  committee  report  also  showed 
faster  reduction  in  poverty  during  2009-10  to  2011-12.  This  indicates  the  success  of 
reforms in reducing poverty. 
Statistically,  change  in  poverty  can  be  separated  into  two  components  (assuming 
constant  inflation  indexed  poverty  line) - Growth  and  redistribution  of  income.  If 
distribution  (i.e.  inequality)  remains  constant,  only  through  growth  can  poverty  be 
addressed.

Student Notes: 
However, as inequality increases, as has been the case in India, the growth would have 
to outstrip the pace of increase in inequality in order to reduce poverty.  Another way 
of seeing this is that if the incomes of the super-rich increase at a higher pace (causing 
increasing inequality), the pace of increase of income of the people below poverty line 
would have to be higher. This is highly unlikely. 
In this kind of scenario, there has be forced redistribution on part of the government. 
With government adding to incomes of poor through welfare schemes, the net growth 
of real income of poor becomes higher, contributing to reduced poverty. 
Higher economic growth, agriculture growth, rural non-farm employment, increase in 
real wages for rural labourers, employment in construction and programmes like the 
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) contributed 
to higher poverty reduction in the 2000s compared to the 1990s. 
World Bank in its latest report also estimated that based on $1.90 income to measure 
extreme poverty, India’s actual extent of poverty may be much less (approx. 11%). Still, 
300 million people live below the poverty line in India. 
Issues with poverty measurement 
• No  unanimity  on  appropriate  parameters  among  different  scholars,  as  shown 
above. 
• Poverty line mainly focuses on economic criteria, whereas poverty may also have 
social,  cultural,  and  political  aspects,  which  are  not  addressed  by  the  current 
approach. 
Way forward 
• Use  the  recently  concluded  Socio-Economic  Caste  Census for  more  effective 
targeting as it’s based on 7 parameters to identify the poor. 
• Accelerate  economic  growth  along  with  redistributive  justice,  for  eliminating 
poverty  in  medium  to  long  term.  For  this  we  need  to  effectively  implement  the 
Sustainable Development Goals. 
 
3. Despite the potential of Special Employment Programmes in alleviating poverty, their 
impact has largely been limited. Comment. Also discuss how they can be made more 
effective. 
Approach: 
• By giving introduction in brief mention some Special Employment Programmes. 
• Discuss  the  role  of  Special  Employment  Programmes  in  alleviating  property  and 
how their role is limited. 
• Suggest some measures to make these programmes more effective. 
Answer: 
Since the 5th five- year plan, India has launched several special employment generation 
programs targeting poverty. 
These programmes largely fall into two categories: 
• Self-Employment Programmes: These include programmes like PM’s Employment 
Generation Programme (PMEGP), NRLM, NULM etc. 
 Shortcomings: 
• Lack of adequate financial resources, skills and capacity, and sustained institutional 
support.

Student Notes: 
• Low survival rate of promoted micro-enterprises. 
• Bureaucratic apathy and corruption at all levels. 
• The incidences of red-tapism by banks.  
• Wage Employment Programmes 
Under  this  the  flagship  program  is  MGNREGA,  launched  in  2005  with  legal  backing 
guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment on demand at statutory minimum wages, 
to people in all rural areas. 
Shortcomings: 
• Work is not adjusted to agricultural lean season resulting in workers migrating for 
work during the lean season.  
• Local  government  machinery  not  able  to  provide  work  for  lack  of  technical  and 
managerial capability.  
• Corruption and fudging of rolls. 
• Delayed or non-payment of wages. 
• Non maintenance of assets created under it. 
• Focus  on  manual  labor  with  little  or  no  provision  of  skill  development  and  its 
utilisation. 
Steps to make programs more effective: 
• Link them with the infrastructural development programmes. 
• Strict monitoring and evaluation made part of the implementation plan. 
• Programmes  should  not  be  judged  only  for  the  economic  impacts  but  for  non-
economic ones also. 
• PRIs also need to be strengthened, especially for extracting accountability. 
• MGNREGA work needs to be in line with lean agricultural season. 
• MGNREGA  should  be  integrated  with  the  ongoing  development  programme, 
including skills and training. 
• Transfering cash directly to intended beneficiaries. 
Poverty is one of the evils that act as a major impediment in the development of the 
country.  To  eradicate  poverty  and  to  achieve  social  inclusion  these  employment 
generation programmes are a necessity. To a make them successful they needs to be 
dove-tailed  with  JAM  (Jan  Dhan,  Aadhar  and  mobile  banking)  and  universal  social 
protection scheme (excluding the better off groups). Also universal basic income as a 
concept is good in tackling the problem of poverty but it need to vetted first. 
 
 
4. Discuss Financial Inclusion as a mean to Inclusive Growth? Also identify the associated 
issues. 
Approach: 
Focus on showing ‘clearly’ how the financial services will help disadvantages section to 
come  out  of  poverty.  Then  discuss  a  few  reasons  why  we  are  not  able  to  achieve 
financial inclusion.  
Answer: 
• Financial inclusion is envisaged to enormously empower the poor through low cost 
banking  services  and  credit,  at  an  affordable  cost  to  the  vast  sections  of 
disadvantaged and low-income groups.  
• In India, more than 40 per cent of households avail no banking service at all. The 
ratio of total bank credit outstanding to GDP is only about 57 per cent as against

Student Notes: 
over 140 per cent in East Asia and Pacific. Insurance premia account for less than 1 
per cent of GDP, which is only about a third of the international average. 
• Owing  to  difficulties  in  accessing  formal  sources of  credit,  poor  individuals  and 
small  and  macro  enterprises  usually  rely  on local  moneylenders,  who  charge 
exhorbitant interest rates and hence they are unable to come out of their poverty 
trap. Access to low cost financial services allows the poor to save money outside 
the house safely, prevents concentration of economic power with a few individuals. 
• Among  the  key financial  services  that  are  of  great  relevance  here  are  risk 
management or risk mitigation services vis-à-vis economic shocks. Such shocks may 
be an income shock due to adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, or an 
expenditure shock due to health emergencies or accidents, leading to a high level 
of unexpected expenditure. This aspect of financial inclusion is of vital importance 
in providing economic security to individuals and families. 
• Financial  services  will  help  in  getting  easy  credit  for  the  small  businesses  and 
farmers  in  agriculture  as  well.  It  affects  the  extent  of  entrepreneurship  and  of 
competition. Though financing of first time entrepreneurs is risky but it a must for 
inclusive growth. Similarly growth in agriculture will be more of inclusive nature. 
• Govt  is  increasingly  relying  on  banking  services e.g. direct  cash  benefits  and 
insurances products etc., to provide benefits to the disadvantaged sections under 
various schemes. This helps in better monitoring of schemes and ensures that there 
are  less  leakages  of  money.  These  efforts  will  only  bring  fruit  if  people  are 
financially inclusive. 
• Issues: 
i. Often people do not have proof of identity to represent themselves formally to 
get into the financial system. 
ii. Govt. banks have limited capacity and private banks are not willing to expand 
their branches in rural areas. 
iii. People lack awareness and access to the sources of information. 
iv. Microfinance institutions have exploited the rural masses e.g. chit fund scams 
or other financial frauds in rural areas. 
v. High transactions costs relative to size of accounts are also the main reason for 
low banking coverage and this is compounded by high risk perception of banks, 
in part because of lack of insurance. 
vi. Agriculture  and  other  forms  of  MSMEs  are  particularly  ill-served  and  the 
situation  has  in  fact  deteriorated  in  some  ways  over  the  last  two  decades 
because of problems afflicting the cooperative banking sector. 
 
vii. Reaching  out  to  the  illiterate  people  or  people  who  can  handle  only  the 
regional   languages   is   also   difficult   without   developing   a   suitable 
communication mode. 
• The promotion of financial inclusion can be done in two major ways:  
1. by expanding the role of the formal financial system, including banking.  
2. through the growth of micro-finance institutions in rural and urban areas.  
• Expansion  of  banking  infrastructure, opening  new  branches,  zero-frills  bank 
accounts,  banking  correspondents(BCs)  (use  of    services  of  intermediaries  in 
providing  financial  and  banking  services  through  the  use  of  Business  Facilitators 
(BFs) and Business Correspondents (BCs), setting up of ultra small branches etc. are 
a few of the modalities under financial inclusion strategies of the govt.

5. Most rural poor are excluded from the ambit of the formal financial system, which 
raises their dependence on informal sources as well as exposure to financial distress. 
In this context, explain why formal sector lending, especially to farmers, is so limited. 
Also suggest some steps that need to be taken to increase access to formal credit in 
rural areas. 
Approach: 
• Introduce the statement by writing about ineffectiveness of formal financial system 
in rural areas. 
• Discuss the limitation of the government’s financial initiatives in rural areas. 
• List the relevant remedies. 
Answer: 
The ratio of agricultural credit to agricultural GDP has increased from 10 per cent in 
1999-2000 to around 38 per cent by 2012-13. However, the share of long-term credit in 
agriculture  or  investment  credit  has  declined  (55  %  in  2006-07  to  39%  in  2011-12).  
Moreover the following trends depict the issues with formal credit in rural sector: 
• Inequity in credit disbursed—the share of loans above Rs.10 lakh is going up and 
over a quarter of the credit is advanced from urban and metropolitan branches of 
banks. These loans mostly cater to input dealers, agri-businesses such as food and 
agro-processing industries and warehousing companies. 
• Steady share of informal sector in loans to agricultural households (around 40%   
between 2003 and 2013). 
• The declining share of small loans (less than 2 lakh). 
• March Phenomenon-banks  lent  over  46%  of  agricultural  credit  between  January 
and  March— perhaps  to  meet  year-end  targets —although  farm  loans  are  most 
likely required before the crop season begins, around June and November.          
Reasons for limited formal nature of credit to farmers 
• Banks’ reluctance to lend to small farmers which is further accentuated by inherent 
risks (say, deficit or unseasonal rains) associated with farming. Partly, the decline 
could also be due to rising costs of cultivation, inflationary pressures, and more 
people moving out of farming 
• A large share of credit has channelized through non-bank financial intermediaries 
without collateral; in contrast to commercial banks, which requires collateral. But 
they charged higher rate of interest and resorted to coercive practices (example: 
microfinance  crisis  in  Andhra  Pradesh.  The  credit  disbursed  by  MFIs  has  not 
resulted  in  raising  agricultural  productivity  because  these  loans  require  regular 
monthly repayments and regular meeting and oversight on borrowers) 
• A  part  of  credit  under  priority  lending  and interest  subvention  scheme  being 
diverted to agribusiness, input dealers etc. 
• High cost of disbursing loans in rural areas and mandated interest rates being too 
low under various schemes. 
• Rural branches have declined to 37% of total branches from 54% in 1994. 
Steps required to be taken 
• Priority Sector Lending Certificate (PSLCs): it will provide a market-driven incentive 
for  efficiency,  will  enable  banks  to  sell  their  surplus  lending  and  thus  earning  a 
premium  for  their  efficiency/geographical  spread.  RBI  has  already  issued 
instructions on trading in Priority Sector Lending Certificates in April this year. 
• Popularising  Negotiable  Warehouse  Receipts  (NWRs): The  small  and  marginal 
farmers  with  Kisan  Credit  Cards  (KCCs)  can  also  avail  the  benefit  of  interest

Student Notes: 
subvention scheme extended for a further period of up to six months (post-harvest) 
against  Negotiable  Warehouse  Receipts  (NWRs)  at  the  same  rate  as  available  to 
crop loan to discourage distress sale of corps by small farmers. 
• Creating  Big-sized  banks: which  unlike  smaller  ones,  have  the  ability  to  cross-
subsidize  their  stakeholders.  Former  RBI  deputy  governor  K.C.  Chakrabarty  has 
highlighted the importance of big banks in improving allocation efficiency between 
rural and urban areas.  
• The  government  may  consider removing the subvention restrictions on  interest 
rates. Then banks would be free to set interest at rates that cover their costs and it 
would make loans viable. 
• The bank may channel credit through non-bank intermediaries such as MFIs and 
allow the MFIs to charge rate of interest above the rate charged by banks.  
• There  should  be provisioning for delivering institutional credit to poor farmers 
without collateral. It may lead to increased credit availability to rural poor.  
• Banking correspondents need to be appointed and adequately incentivized with 
commissions linked to loan repayments.  
• There is also a need to incentivize the financial institutions to provide farmers with 
credit.  
 
6. Examine the advantages of direct cash transfer of subsidies over other mechanisms of 
disbursing  them.  In  this  context,  bringing  out  the  role  of  JAM  Trinity,  identify  the 
challenges in its implementation and suggest possible solutions to address them. 
Approach: 
• Evaluate the advantages of direct cash transfer of subsidies. 
• Bring out the role of JAM Trinity in its implementation. 
• Discuss the challenges in its implementation. 
• Conclude by suggesting possible solutions. 
Answer: 
Direct cash transfer is a mechanism by which government subsidies and other benefits 
are directly credited in the bank account of beneficiary. 
Advantages 
• Market  distortions  are  minimized through  direct  cash  transfers  of  subsidies. 
Otherwise dual price markets are created where two sets of prices for the same 
goods are present. 
• Leakages, corruption and black marketing can be eliminated by direct transfer of 
cash.  In  PDS  system  where  goods are  physically  moved,  lots  of  diversions  take 
place. 
• Cash  transfer  reduces  cost  and  is  simpler  to  administer.  Government  spends  a 
huge amount of money over administrative apparatus for subsidy disbursement.  
Role of JAM 
For effecting direct cash transfers, government must be able to identify beneficiaries;. 
transfer money to beneficiaries; and beneficiaries must be able to easily access their 
money. 
• Aadhar helps in beneficiary identification. 
• Jan  Dhan  Yojana increased  people  with  bank  accounts.  It  enables  transferring 
money to intended beneficiaries.  
• The Mobile  money  payments technologies  enable  beneficiaries  to  access  their 
money.

Student Notes: 
Challenges in implementation 
The implementation challenges can be categorized as first mile, middle mile and last 
mile challenges. 
First mile 
• Targeting: targeted subsidies require detailed information about beneficiaries. 
• Beneficiary  databases:  the  databases  needs  to  be  continuously  updated  and 
seeded with Aadhaar and bank account information and mobile numbers. 
• Eligibility: Some benefits are for households while others are for individuals. 
Middle mile 
• Within-government  coordination:  ministries  and  state  government  departments 
share authority in administering subsidies and transfers. 
• Supply  chain  interest  groups:  agents  along  a  commodity’s  supply  chain  can 
obstruct the spread of JAM if their interests are threatened. 
Last mile 
• Beneficiary financial inclusion: in rural areas physical connectivity to the banking 
system remains limited.  
• Beneficiary  vulnerability:  exclusion  error  risks  increase  when  the  beneficiary 
population is poorer. 
Way forward 
The government should incentivize the ministries and states to: 
• Invest in first-mile capacity (by improving beneficiary databases).  
• Deal  with  middle-middle  challenges  (by  designing  incentives  for  supply  chain 
interest groups to support DBT).  
• Improve last-mile financial connectivity (by developing the BC and mobile money 
space). 
 
7. Suggest some measures to make implementation of Targeted PDS more effective. 
Approach: 
Straight forward question. Suggest few measures. 
Answer: 
• Sugar should be kept outside the purview of PDS. It should be decontrolled and the 
system of levy on sugar discontinued.  
• The average shelf life of coarse grains is limited, making them unsuitable for long-
term  storage  and  distribution  under  PDS.  Initiatives  on  the  part  of  state 
governments catering to the needs of specific localities are possible. 
• Kerosene  oil  witness  large-scale  diversion  of  this  commodity  and  subsidized 
kerosene is used for adulteration with diesel. The subsidy on kerosene should be 
phased  out  by  raising  its  supply  price  under  PDS  while  eliminating  all  domestic 
central nd state taxes on it. 
• All further attempts to include more and more commodities under the coverage of 
food subsidy should be resisted. 
• The FPS should be permitted to sell all commodities (other than rice and wheat) at 
full market prices in order to ensure their economic viability.

8. Starvation in the midst of plenty; this reflects the sorry state of affairs associated with 
the issue of food security today. In light of this statement, what role does buffer stock 
play  in  promoting  food  security?  Comment  on  the  Institutional  Setup  for  the 
management  of  buffer  stocks  and  bring  forward  challenges  as  well  as  solutions 
associated with the same. 
Approach: 
Explain  the  concept  of  Buffer  Stock  and  why  it  is  required  to  maintain.  Further, 
Elaborate  on  the  institutional  setup  for  the  management  of  stocks,  analysing  the 
current shortcomings and suggestions for revamping the system.  
Answer: 
The Buffer norms are the minimum food grains the Centre should have in the Central 
pool  at  the  beginning  of  each  quarter  to  meet  requirement  of  public  distribution 
system and other welfare measures. Buffer stock constitutes an important parameter 
for  ensuring  food  security  in  the  country.  It  is  well  known  that  a  modicum  of  self-
sufficiency in food is desirable which immediately means that the state will have the 
responsibility of maintaining a certain amount of food stocks. Further, it is argued that 
in a big country like ours, it is politically risky to rely entirely on private traders and 
international trade to iron out excessive price fluctuation and international experiences 
in the past have shown that relying entirely on international market comes with its own 
strategic costs.  
Maintaining buffer stocks helps in achieving multiple objectives i.e. they are required to 
feed TPDS and other welfare schemes; ensure food security during the periods when 
production is short of normal demand during bad agricultural years and stabilize prices 
during period of production shortfall through open market sales. 
The  Food  Corporation  of  India,  is  the  nodal  agency  for  procurement,  storage  and 
release of food grains in India. It was setup under the Food Corporation Act 1964. The 
objectives of FCI are  
• Effective price support operations for safeguarding the interests of the farmers 
• Distribution of food grains throughout the country for public distribution system 
• Maintaining  satisfactory  level  of  operational  and  buffer  stocks of  food  grains  to 
ensure National Food Security.   
Buffer stocks have been under frequent attacks in recent times. The level of stocks is 
said to be too high in relation to the buffer stock norms which is causing huge cost in 
terms of storage, interest on value of produce, and wastage, tying up huge resources 
that  could  have  been  put  to  better  use.    It  is  argued  that  price  stabilization  can  be 
better achieved through trade rather than stocks and the former is found to be much 
cheaper than latter. Further, it is also argued that buffer stocks for absorbing shocks due 
to  production  fluctuation  were  justified  when  India  did  not  have  enough  foreign 
exchange reserve to maintain excessive stocks held by public agencies. 
What needs to be done is to vary our procurement, taking in more when the weather is 
good, supply plentiful and with low prices, when the weather is bad and prices are high. 
Further, the efficacy of the policy of offloading of grains is enormously dependent on 
the size of packages to be offloaded in the open market.  
Inspired  by  the  sight  of  food  grain  going  waste,  it  is  often  made  out  to  be  that  our 
central problem is that of poor food grain storage. Though there is no doubt regarding 
improving our storage facilities, it is important to be clear that this will not lower the 
price of food. To achieve that we need to redesign the mechanics of how we acquire 
and release food on the market.

9. Financial  inclusion  is  a  pre  requisite  for  inclusive  growth  in  India.  What  do  you 
understand  by  the  term  financial  inclusion?  What  are  the  challenges  to  achieve 
financial inclusion in India? Examine the various models of financial inclusion in India. 
Approach:  
• Define Financial inclusion. 
• Establish a relation between financial inclusion and inclusive growth.  
• Discuss the challenges in achieving financial inclusion.  
• Examine the various models of financial inclusion. 
Answer: 
Financial Inclusion is the process of ensuring access to appropriate financial products 
and services needed by deprived and low income groups at an affordable cost, in a fair 
and transparent manner. 
 
Financial Inclusion and Inclusive growth 
Inclusive growth implies participation as well as sharing the benefits from the growth 
process. Financial inclusion and inclusive growth are the two sides of same coin. Both 
are interrelated and interdependent. For growth to be inclusive, all people should be 
come under access to financial services. 
Challenges in achieving Financial Inclusion  
• Inadequate last mile delivery. 
• Lack of financial literacy, lack of awareness of financial services and products, social 
exclusion and the unsuitable products for the poor. 
• Naxal  Movement,  low  Return-on-Investment  (ROI),  operating  expenses inhibits 
banks from expansion in rural areas. 
• Low formal link of micro and small enterprises. 
• Seasonal inflow of income from agricultural operations. 
• Migration from one place to another. 
• Seasonal and irregular work availability 
• Over indebtedness. 
• Agrarian Distress 
The two most prominent model of Financial Inclusion in India are: 
• Business Correspondent model 
• Bank led or Brick and Mortar Branch Model

Student Notes: 
Business correspondent Model: 
The role of Business Correspondents (BCs) is considered as important for increasing the 
extent  of  financial  inclusion  in  rural  areas.  They  offer  cost –effective  alternative  to 
traditional brick-mortar branch approach. However their effectiveness is limited by the 
following concerns:  
• Low aspirational value of BC as a profession: The lack of permanency and growth 
opportunities are important reasons for the low value attached to the profession. 
• Preference for a brick and mortar branch: Large segment of the population was 
not comfortable with salesman like BC and preferred a brick and mortar branch for 
banking 
• BCs  are  not  making  enough  income  due  to  catering  of services  to  low-income 
customers with low volume transactions.  
More and more innovative products will have to be introduced which would benefit 
both banks as well as the rural people and at the same time make the BC model more 
viable. 
Bank led Model: 
The bank- led model requires increasing density of bank branches to promote financial 
inclusion. The goal of financial inclusion is better served through mainstream banking 
institutions as only they have the ability to offer the suite of products required to bring 
in effective/meaningful financial inclusion.  
However, in rural and remote areas, it is not always financially viable to operate bank 
branches.  To  overcome  this  challenge,  the  Banking  Correspondence  model  has  been 
adopted by many banks. 
Thus, India requires blend of both the models to promote financial inclusion. The job of 
BC need to be made more specialized and adequate training should be imparted. On 
the  other  hand,  banks  should  partner  with  new  finance – technology  companies  to 
promote financial inclusion. 
 
10. Instead of running piecemeal schemes that do not address the specific challenge of 
poverty-ridden households it is better to use concrete tools such as SECC. In light of 
the  above  statement,  explain  how  SECC  data  can  be  utilized  to address  multi-
dimensional aspects of poverty. 
Approach: 
• Highlight  failure  of  earlier  approaches  in  getting  results.  Discuss  benefits  of  a 
targeted approach.  
• Enumerate the criteria for determining deprivation in SECC. 
• Mention how can various schemes be targeted based on these criteria. 
Answer: 
Anti-poverty  programmes  in  the  past  have  been  based  on  National  Sample  Surveys, 
covering 1,50,000 households nationally. However, reliability and utility of even such a 
large survey declines as one moves down administrative levels. The programmes and 
targets have been based on national averages, which have less relevance in the local 
context. Further, these have been based on household’s consumption expenditure and 
sources of livelihood, and do not consider asset ownership pattern, which is also an 
important determinant of design of poverty alleviation program.

Student Notes: 
The  SECC  data,  on  the  other  hand  addresses  multi-dimensionality  of  poverty  by 
identifying  indicators  of  deprivation  and  consequent  inclusion  or  exclusion  of 
households from poverty alleviation programmes. It divides the total rural households 
(17.91 Cr) into three categories: 
• Automatically included: Based on fulfilling any of the 5 of the criteria viz. Primitive 
tribal Groups, Released bonded labour, those living on alms, manual scavengers or 
households without shelter. 
• Automatically excluded: Based on fulfilling any of the 14 parameters of exclusion 
such  as  motorised  vehicle/fishing  boat,  mechanised  agricultural  equipment,  KCC 
limit more than Rs. 50,000, etc. 
• Households based on 7 markers of deprivation:  
o Households with Kutchha house 
o No adult member in working age 
o Household headed by female and no working age male member 
o Household with handicapped members and no able bodied adult 
o Household with no literate over 25 years 
o Landless households engaged in manual labour 
o SC/ST households. 
Households of third category show poverty on some markers, even though the depth of 
poverty  may  not  be  enough  to  categorise  them  as  absolute  poor.  Rather  than  using 
income as a sole determinant, SECC data addresses this multidimensionality of poverty. 
It  provides  information  to  assess  dimensions  of  poverty  in  a  household – income, 
literacy, disease, social or gender inequality, indebtness, exploitation and landlessness.  
The  data  can  be  utilised  for  a  convergent,  evidence  based  planning  with  Gram 
Panchayat as a unit. It provides for criteria based selection, prioritisation and targeting 
of beneficiaries in different programmes. For example, 2.34 Crore households with one 
room  or  less  and  kutchha  house  should  be  the  first  claimants  of  any  rural  housing 
scheme  when  targeted  properly.  Instead  of  extending  monetary  help  to  a  homeless 
family,  the  government  should  be  providing  them  with  a  house  under  one  of  its 
schemes  and  use  the  funds  for  sustaining  livelihood  through  skill  development, 
MGNREGS, etc. 
The  data  shows  inter-state  and  intra-state  variations  in  states  that  were  presumed 
similar – Bihar has much higher landlessness (51%) than UP (31%); Tamil Nadu (56%) is 
more than Karnataka (22%). It will help governments at all levels to delve into variations 
across regions, identify the causes of deprivation and design differentiated approaches 
to tackle poverty. 
Used effectively, the SECC data can be leveraged to combine economies of scale with 
benefits of precision targeting. With use of technology, progress can be monitored on 
real time basis and targets and targeted groups updated regularly. 
 
11. Rising income inequality is a widespread concern for advanced as well as emerging 
economies.  Illustrate  how  inequality  impedes  economic  growth.  Also,  examine  the 
steps taken by India to tackle income inequality. 
Approach: 
• Introduce the answer by illustrating the rising income inequality. 
• Discuss the impact of income inequality on economic growth. 
• Analyze the initiatives by India to reduce income inequality.

Student Notes: 
Answer: 
Widening  income  inequality  is  the  defining  challenge  of  our  time.  In  advanced 
economies,  the  gap  between  the  rich  and  poor  is  at  its  highest  level  in  decades. 
Inequality trends have been more mixed in emerging markets and developing countries 
(EMDCs),  with  some  countries  experiencing  declining  inequality,  but  pervasive 
inequities in access to education, health care and finance remain. 
Wealth  is  now  even  more concentrated  at  the  top  level,  exacerbating  the  overall 
disadvantage of low-income households. In 2012, the bottom 40% owned only 3% of 
total household wealth. In contrast, the top 10% controlled half of all total household 
wealth  and  the  wealthiest  1%  owned  18%.  The  top  1%  share  almost  10%  of  total 
income worldwide. 
Economic Growth and Income Inequality: 
• Inequality affects growth drivers. Higher inequality lowers growth by depriving the 
ability  of  lower-income  households  to  stay  healthy  and  accumulate  physical  and 
human capital.  
• For instance, it can lead to underinvestment in education as poor children end up in 
lower-quality  schools  and  are  less  able  to  go  on  to  college.  As  a  result,  labor 
productivity could be lower than it would have been in a more equitable world. 
• Increasing  concentration  of  incomes  could  also  reduce  aggregate  demand  and 
undermine growth, because the wealthy spend a lower fraction of their incomes 
than middle- and lower-income groups 
• Inequality dampens investment and hence growth by fueling economic, financial 
and political instability. Extreme inequality may damage trust and social cohesion 
and thus is also associated with conflicts, which discourage investment.  
• A growing body of evidence suggests that rising influence of the rich and stagnant 
incomes  of  the  poor  and  middle  class  have  a  causal  effect  on  crises,  and  thus 
directly hurt short- and long-term growth. In particular, studies have argued that a 
prolonged period of higher inequality in advanced economies was associated with 
the global financial crisis of 2008. 
Examining steps taken by India to reduce Income inequality: 
• Social  protection  is  a  cushion  for  those  at  the  bottom  against  the  effects  of 
inequality. Social protection policies play an important role in reducing poverty and 
inequality  and  supporting  inclusive  growth  by  boosting  human  capital.  However, 
India  fares  poorly  in  case  of  social  protection  measures.  The  global  average  on 
social  spending  is  8.8%  of  GDP.  Among  BRICS  nations,  India  spends  the  lowest 
proportion of public expenditure on social protection around 4%, while the highest 
is Brazil with 21.2%. 
• The  performance  of  existing  protection  measures  is  dismal  in  terms  of  access, 
quality and equity. Health, education and nutrition schemes face great challenges. 
• Taxation policy is critical in income redistribution. Regressive tax code and complex 
tax structure has resulted in widespread tax evasion in India. The redistributive role 
of  fiscal  policy  could  be  reinforced  by  greater  reliance  on  wealth  and  property 
taxes, more progressive income taxation, removing opportunities for tax avoidance 
and evasion. Government is in the process to reform the tax code in India. However, 
the rate of reforms is dismal. Direct tax code, Goods and Services tax proposals are 
still awaiting the approval by the Parliament.

Student Notes: 
1.	Introduction	
Infrastructure is the support system on which depends the efficient working of a modern 
industrial economy. Infrastructure contributes to economic development of a country both by 
increasing the productivity of the factors of production and improving the quality of life of its 
people. It provides supporting services not only for industrial and agricultural production, but 
also for domestic and foreign trade and commerce.  
These  services  include  roads,  railways,  ports,  airports,  dams,  power  stations,  oil  and gas 
pipelines, telecommunication facilities, the country’s educational system including schools and 
colleges, health system including hospitals, sanitary system including clean drinking water 
facilities and the monetary system including banks, insurance and other financial institutions. 
Some of these facilities have a direct impact on the working of the system of production while 
others give indirect support by building the social sector of the economy.   
2.	Infrastructure	&	Economic	Development	
Infrastructure works both directly and indirectly on a number of determinants of economic 
development, such as follows:  
•
 Improving growth: To achieve the GDP of $5 trillion by 2024-25, India needs to spend about 
$1.4 trillion (Rs. 100 lakh crore) over these 
years on infrastructure (as announced under 
National Infrastructure Pipeline) 
•
 Increase   in   investment: It  opens  up 
possibilities  of  investment  by  making 
available a number of necessary inputs and 
services, opening up the size of the market 
as well as increasing the supply elasticity and 
efficiency of factors of production.  
•
 Industrial development: It also depends on a 
sound infrastructure base to a large extent.  
•
 Employment generation: Infrastructure plays 
a  significant  role  in  the  generation  of 
employment opportunities. They improve mobility, productivity and efficiency of labour.  
•
 Trade & commerce: Infrastructure facilities play a vital role in the development of trade and 
commerce. In fact they act as a platform for the expansion of trade and other commercial 
activities at a rapid speed. 
Thus, infrastructure development can have a significant impact on economic growth. For low-
income countries basic infrastructure such as water, irrigation and to lesser extent transport 
are important. As the economies mature into middle-income category, the share of power and 
transport  and  telecommunications  in  infrastructure  and  investment increases. Also, 
infrastructure not only contributes towards the development of backward regions and removal 
of  regional  imbalance but  also acts as  an instrument  of  social  change. Extensive  studies 
undertaken  by the World  Bank show that 1%  increase  in  investment  in  the  stock  of 
infrastructure leads to a corresponding 1% increase in the Gross Domestic Product of a nation. 
Why infrastructure needs an overhaul? 
•
 Increasing  urbanization: 42 per cent of population to live in urban areas in 2030 as 
opposed to 31 per cent now. Moreover, contribution of urban areas in total employment 
will increase at a higher rate than the contribution of rural areas during the period 2018-
30.  
•
 Shift  to  services-based  economy: The trends in GDP and employment are reflective of 
India’s economy gradually transitioning from an agrarian economy to a service centric 
economy requiring overhaul in infrastructure.

Student Notes: 
•
 Climate change and disaster resilience: There is a clear need for ensuring that all new and 
existing infrastructure systems are climate and disaster resilient.  
•
 Improving  global  competitiveness: infrastructure bottleneck is a primary constraint in 
terms  of  India’s  competitiveness,  as  reflected in  the  World  Economic  Forum’s  Global 
Competitiveness Index. India’s Rank- in overall infrastructure quality is 70 out of 140 
countries.  
3.	Roads	and	Road	Transport	
The share of transport sector in the GVA for 2017-18 was about 4.77 per cent of which the 
share of road transport is the largest at 3.06 per cent, followed by the share of the Railways 
(0.75 per cent), air transport (0.15 per cent) and water transport (0.06 per cent). 
Transport and connectivity are central to India’s economy and society.  
• Contributes to growth directly as it accounts for a large part of construction activity.  
• The transport sector facilitates trade and migration, thereby raising productivity in other 
parts of the economy. 
• The movement of people, which this sector facilitates, Its a key source of social integration 
and transformation 
Road Transport is a critical infrastructure for the economic development of a country. It impacts 
the pace, structure and pattern of development. India has the second largest road network in 
the  world  of  about  58.98  lakh  km.  This  comprises  National  Highways,  Expressways,  State 
Highways, Major District Roads, Other District Roads and Village Roads as under:  
National Highways 1,32,500 km 
State Highways 1,56,694 km 
Other Roads 56,08,477 km 
Total 58,97,671 km 
The road sector in India accounts for the largest share in the movement of both passengers 
and freight. As per the National Transport Development Policy Committee Report, as of 2011-
12, road transport is estimated to handle 69 per cent and 90 per cent of the countrywide 
freight and passenger traffic, respectively. Driven by a rapidly growing economy, access to 
vehicle finance and improved road connectivity, the demand for mobility on roads has risen 
continuously, leading to a sharp rise in the number of road transport vehicles. The total number 
of registered vehicles in India increased from 58.9 million in 2001-02 to 182.4 million in 2012-
13,4 a CAGR of almost 11 per cent during this period.  
The private sector has emerged as a key player in the development of road infrastructure in 
India. The government’s policy to increase private sector participation has proved to be a boon 
for the infrastructure industry with a large number of private players entering the business 
through the public-private partnership (PPP) model. In PPP, different types of model are being 
used by the government – Hybrid Annuity Model, Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) Model, Build-
Operate and Transfer (BOT), Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) etc. (More  on 
these will be discussed in Investment Models Document) 
Also, the Government has permitted 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the road 
sector, thus facilitating several foreign companies in entering into partnerships with Indian 
players to capitalise on the sector's growth. 
3.1.	Constraints	
•
 Capacity of existing highways: The existing length of the NH network is only about 2.2 per 
cent of the country’s total road network and in that also the NH length with 4-lane standard 
is just about 22 per cent.

Student Notes: 
o Further, national and state highways are already overstrained, carrying more than 65 
per cent of the road traffic. National highways carry 40 per cent of India’s total road 
traffic.  
•
 Maintenance of existing infrastructure: The annual outlay earmarked for maintenance and 
repair of national highway stretches is only about 40 per cent of the funds required. This is 
one of the main reasons for the inability to take up timely maintenance interventions.  
•
 Accidents and safety concerns: Road safety is a major issue in the country with nearly 400 
road related deaths being recorded daily. In 2013, India had an accident death rate of 18.9 
for every 100,000 people, higher than other South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, 
Mauritius and Sri Lanka. At least a part of the fatalities is because of the poor quality of 
roads.  
•
 Cost escalation for roads: Delays in acquiring land can affect project costs as the average 
cost of land has escalated from Rs. 0.80 crore per hectare during 2012-13 to Rs. 3.20 crore 
per hectare during 2017-18. 
3.2.	Government	Initiatives	
The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) is mandated with the development and 
maintenance of road networks especially the National Highways as well as the implementation 
of the Motor Vehicle Act under which it formulates broad policies relating to road transport 
3.2.1.	Bharatmala	Pariyojana		
•
 It aims at construction/ up-gradation of National Highways of 34,800 kms length over a 
period of 5 years (2017-18 to 2021-22).  
•
 The programme focuses on optimizing efficiency of freight and passenger movement across 
the  country  by  bridging  critical  infrastructure  gaps  through  effective  interventions  like 
development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes, National Corridor 
Efficiency  Improvement,  Border  and  International  Connectivity  roads,  Coastal  and  Port 
Connectivity roads and Green-field expressways.  
•
 Multi-modal integration is also built into this program. Special attention has been paid to 
fulfilling the connectivity needs of backward and tribal areas, areas of economic activity, 
places of religious and tourist interest, border areas, coastal areas and trade routes with 
neighbouring countries.  
•
 The project is to be funded through debt funds, private investment or from central road 
fund or toll collection.  
•
 The main agencies tasked with the construction are the National Highways Authority of 
India, National Highway and Industrial Development Corporation and State Public Works 
Department. 
3.2.2.	Infrastructure	Investment	Fund	(InvIT)		
NHAI has been given the mandate to set up an InvIT to monetize its completed stretches of 
public funded national highways with the objective of mobilizing additional resources through 
capital markets. These are investment scheme similar to mutual funds that allow investment 
from individuals and institutional investors in infrastructure projects to earn a portion of the 
income as return. NHAI's InvIT will be a trust established under the Indian Trust Act, 1882 and 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014. 
It will attract long-term capital, allowing the investors to have an indirect exposure in the 
project(s). This proposition is more attractive for foreign investors, which are hesitant to take 
direct exposure in highway projects.  
NHAI currently addresses its funding requirement through ToT (toll-operatetransfer), partnering 
NIIF  (National  Investment  and  Infrastructure  Fund),  issuance  of  bonds  to  LIC  and  central 
budgetary allocations.

Student Notes: 
Some  recommendations  of  Rakesh  Mohan  Committee  (National  Transport  Development  Policy 
Committee (NTDPC)) 
• Roads  should not  be  looked  at  in  isolation,  but  as  part  of  an  integrated  multi-modal  system  of 
transport. The planning and development of the primary road network must tie up with planning of 
railways’ dedicated freight corridors and other segments of rail network, connectivity with ports, 
airports, SEZs, logistic hubs, major tourist centres and linkage with neighbouring countries. 
• The program of PMGSY should be expanded to achieve universal connectivity to all habitations on 
time bound basis. 
• There  is  need  for  continuous  upgradation  of  technology  in  the  auto  industry,  especially  the 
commercial vehicle sector, to meet the objectives of better comfort, productivity, energy efficiency, 
safety and emission standards in line with international practices and standards. 
• Private sector financing in the highways will remain confined to commercially viable and high traffic 
density stretches. It will be prudent, therefore, to enhance the availability of public sector funding. 
• The existing network of National Highways and State Highways may be expanded in tune with the 
economic growth and development of industrial hubs, SEZs, ports, tourist centers and connectivity 
to international routes –  Asian Highways and the European Road Network. 
• States  should  encourage  citizen  and  user  oversight  through  undertaking  road  user  satisfaction 
surveys. 
• A dedicated road design institute should be set up, which should function under the umbrella of 
MoRTH. Similar institutes should be set up in each state PWD and Rural Roads Agency. 
4.	Railways	
The Indian Railways had a modest beginning in 1853 when the first train journeyed from 
Mumbai  to  Thane,  covering  a 
distance of 34 km. Currently, the 
Indian Railways (IR) is the fourth 
largest network in the world in 
terms of route km (67,368 km in 
FY17). 
During the year 2018-19, Indian 
Railways  carried  120  crore 
tonnes of freight and 840 crore 
passengers making it the world’s 
largest passenger carrier and 4th 
largest freight carrier. 
The national railway network is 
divided into 17 zones, which are further subdivided into divisions. There are a total of 68 
divisions. There are thirteen undertakings under the control of the Ministry of Railways. 
Modernization/upgradation of Railway stations in Indian Railways is a continuous and on-going 
process. 1,253 stations have been identified for development under Adarsh Station Scheme and 
are planned to be developed by 2019-20. A dedicated SPV, Indian Railway Station Development 
Corporation (IRSDC) Limited has been set up to carry out modernization of railway stations. 
IRSDC is working on modernization of many stations on PPP mode 
4.1.	Issues	
•
 Congested networks: Over-stretched infrastructure with 60 per cent plus routes being more 
than 100 per cent utilized, leading to a reduction in average speed of passenger and freight 
trains.  
•
 Organizational  structure: Delays in decision-making, inadequate market orientation and 
long  project  approval  durations  lead  to  slow  turnover  times  and  delays  in  the 
implementation of railways projects.

Student Notes: 
•
 Internal generation of resources: Negligible non-fare revenues and high freight tariffs have 
led to a sub-optimal freight share. The lower relative cost of transporting freight by road 
has led to a decline in the share of the railways. Low and static prices for the passenger 
segment have also contributed to low internal generation of resources.  
•
 Safety and poor quality of service delivery: There have been a number of accidents and 
safety issues in the IR in recent years. Poor cleanliness of trains and stations, delays in train 
departures/arrivals, quality of food and difficulties in booking tickets are key issues.  
o Anil Kakodkar committee was appointed in 2011 for reviewing the rail safety issues and 
recommend improvements.  Committee observed key issues: poor financial condition, 
inadequate performance and lack of autonomy at functional level. 
•
 Efficiency  of  terminals:  Poor  terminal  facilities  lengthen  loading  and  unloading  times. 
Eighty per cent of railway loads come from terminals. The functioning of terminals needs to 
be strengthened to improve rail freight.  
4.2.	Key	Developments	
4.2.1.	Private	Participation	in	Railways	
Bibek Debroy Committee in 2015 recommended that private entry into running both freight 
and passenger trains should be allowed. Ministry of Railways has invited private participation 
for operation of passenger train services over 109 Origin Destination (OD) pairs of routes using 
151 modern trains on existing rail infrastructure. 
It would be the first initiative of private investment for running passenger trains over Indian 
Railways network attracting investments of an estimated ₹30,000 crore which is expected to 
begin in 2023. 
Entry of new operators is said to bring  in  competition with Indian railways and encourage 
growth and improve services. 
•
 It would help meet increasing demand of railways which is not met currently. As per 
Railway Board, 5 crore intending passengers could not be accommodated during 2019-20 
for want of capacity. 
•
 It would ensure modernisation of services offered to passengers in terms of cleanliness, 
quality of food, safety, delays etc. 
•
 The recent initiative also aims to introduce modern technology rolling stock with reduced 
maintenance and provide world class travel experience to passengers. 
However, there are apprehensions that if IR itself plays the role of regulator (or there is no 
independent regulator) then it would be detrimental to the competition and interests of private 
sector. Moreover, railways also tend to cross-subsidize passenger fares through freight revenue. 
This translates to below cost pricing, which will make it difficult for private players to compete. 
Pros and Cons of privatization in railways 
Benefits  Challenges 
• Improved  efficiency:  A  private  firm  is  interested  in 
making a profit, and so it is more likely to cut costs 
and be efficient.  
• Lack  of  political  interference:  Governments  often 
make poor economic managers as they are motivated 
by  political  pressures  rather than  sound  economic 
and business sense.  
• Long term Planning: A government might think only in 
terms  of  the  next  election  and  thus  be  unwilling  to 
invest  in  infrastructure  improvements  which  will 
benefit  the  firm  in  the  long  term.  This  could  be 
facilitated by private enterprises.  
• Natural  monopoly:  Privatization  in 
railways   might   create   a   private 
monopoly  which  might  seek  to  set 
higher    prices    which    exploit 
consumers.  
• Public  interest: Given  that  a  private 
enterprise runs on profit, it might hike 
fares,  thus  rendering  the  service  out 
of reach for lower income groups.  
• Coverage   Limited   to   Lucrative 
Sectors:  With  privatization  routes 
which  are  less  popular  could  be

Student Notes: 
• Shareholders:  Private  players  face  pressure  from 
shareholders to perform efficiently.  
• Increased  competition:  It  would  ensure  improved 
quality of service with competitive fares.  
• Prevent  Government’s  loss:  The  revenue  generated 
by the  Indian  Railways  is  low  and  keeps  the  system 
always in losses.  
• Improved quality of service: The quality of service in 
Indian  Railways  faces  massive  criticism  especially  in 
the fields of catering and punctuality.  
• Latest technology: The privatization will also help in 
accommodating  the  latest  technology  in  railway 
coaches, station facilities, online services etc.  
• Lesser  accidents:  Private  ownership  is  considered 
synonymous  with  better  maintenance,  which  will 
reduce the number of accidents, thus resulting in safe 
travel and higher monetary savings in the long run.  
• Reducing the supply demand deficit: Since waitlisted 
passengers   comprise   ~15%   of   the   reserved 
passengers.  
• •  Facilitating  capacity  augmentation:  as  capacity 
constraints lead to loss of passenger business to other 
modes such as air travel. 
eliminated,  thus  having  a  negative 
impact  on  connectivity,  rendering 
some  parts  of  the  country  virtually 
inaccessible.  
• Accountability: Private companies are 
unpredictable in their dealings and do 
not  share  their  governance  secrets 
with  the  world  at  large.  In  such  a 
scenario  it  would  be  difficult  to  pin 
the  accountability  on  a  particular 
entity, in case of a discrepancy.  
• Fragmentation  in  railways  industry: 
In  the  UK,  rail  privatization  led  to 
breaking  up  the  rail  network  into 
infrastructure  and  train  operating 
companies. This led to areas where it 
was unclear who had responsibility.  
• Regulatory  Burden:  High  costs  and 
lower returns, policy uncertainty, lack 
of a regulator to create a level playing 
field,  lack  of  incentives  for  investors 
and   procedural/operational   issues 
such as delays in land acquisition etc. 
have  significantly  restricted  private 
sector participation. 
4.2.2.	Railway	restructuring	
Recently,  Union  Cabinet  approved  organisational  restructuring  of  the  Indian  Railways  (IR). 
Presently, the management and administration of Railways is governed by a pool of Group A 
officers, drawn from Indian Engineering Services (such as Indian Railway Service of Engineers 
etc.) and the Civil Services (such as Indian Railway Traffic Service etc.) in eight technical and 
non-technical cadres respectively. 
This was recommended by many committees in the past including Bibek Debroy committee, 
Sam Pitroda committee etc. The main reason behind this is that railway departments are 
currently working “in silos”, which manifests itself in the form of unhealthy competition among 
departments as well as pursuing narrow departmental goals at the cost of organisational goals 
and objectives.  
What is approved in restructuring? 
•
 Creation of Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS): A unified central service by the 
unification of the existing eight Group A services of the Railways in consultation with 
Department  of  Personnel  and  Training  and  UPSC  to  facilitate  recruitment  and  enable 
Railways to recruit engineers/non-engineers as per need.  
•
 Re-organisation  of  Railway  Board: Railway  board  will  no  longer  be  organised  on 
departmental lines, and replaced with a leaner structure organised on functional lines.  
o The board will have a Chairman, who will act as 'Chief Executive Officer (CEO)' along 
with 4 Members responsible for Infrastructure, Operations & Business Development, 
Rolling Stock and Finance respectively.  
o The Board will also have some independent members, who will be highly distinguished 
professionals with deep knowledge and 30 years of experience including at the top 
levels in industry, finance, economics and management fields to help Railway Board in 
setting a strategic direction.  
•
 The existing service of Indian Railway Medical Service (IRMS) to be consequently renamed 
as Indian Railway Health Service (IRHS).

4.2.3.	Dedicated	Freight	Corridors	(DFCs)	
The  Indian  Railways'  quadrilateral  linking  the  four 
metropolitan  cities  of  Delhi, Mumbai,  Chennai  and 
Howrah, commonly known as the Golden Quadrilateral; 
and  its  two  diagonals  (Delhi-Chennai  and  Mumbai-
Howrah), adding up to a total route length of 10,122 km 
carries more than 55% of revenue earning freight traffic 
of IR. The existing trunk routes of Howrah-Delhi on the 
Eastern  Corridor  and  Mumbai-Delhi  on  the  Western 
Corridor  are  highly  saturated, with line  capacity 
utilization varying between 115-150 per cent. 
The  surging  power  needs  requiring  heavy  coal 
movement,  booming  infrastructure construction  and 
growing international trade has led to the conception of 
the Dedicated Freight Corridors. The Sanctioned Dedicated Freight Corridors are: 
• Western  Dedicated  Freight  Corridor,  (Dadri,  U.P  to  Jawaharlal  Nehru  Port,  Mumbai— 
1,468 km) (WDFC) 
• Eastern  Dedicated  Freight  Corridor,  (Ludhiana  Punjab  to  Dankuni  West  Bengal— 
1,760 km) (EDFC) 
• Four  more  Freight  Corridors  were  also  announced  later - East-West  Corridor  (Kolkata-
Mumbai);  North-South  Corridor  (Delhi-Chennai);  East  Coast  Corridor  (Kharagpur-
Vijaywada); Southern Corridor (Chennai-Goa) 
Being executed by the Dedicated  Freight  Corridor  Corporation  of  India  Limited  (DFCCIL), a 
Special Purpose Vehicle set up under the Ministry of Railways in 2006, the dedicated freight 
corridors will provide relief to the railways’ heavily congested Golden Quadrilateral along the 
western and eastern rail routes, and facilitate fresh industrial activity and multi-modal value-
addition services hubs along the corridors. 
Other significance of DFC is that the diversion of freight to DFCs on trunk routes will free up the 
existing network for the kind of capacity expansion needed for passenger movement. It will 
bring fundamental changes by reduction  in  unit  cost  of  transportation,  smaller  organization 
and management cost, with higher efficiency and lower energy consumption.  
• DFC can allow train speed to a maximum of 100 kmph from the current average speed of 
around 25kmph. 
• It will allow a time-tabled freight services for movement of the cargo to the gateway ports 
with guaranteed transit time. This would enhance international connectivity from India 
Challenges faced  
• Issue  of  Land  Acquisition: Due to route alignment, the railways have to acquire large 
swathes of private land that are already developed, making the construction of the corridor 
difficult. The ministry is also required to pay market price for any land acquisition, further 
compounding to financial problem.  
• Concern over technology: While the railways want to run double-stacked containers in the 
DelhiMumbai corridor on diesel locomotives, Japanese International Cooperation Agency 
(JICA),  which  has  financed  the  project,  has  suggested  electric  ones,  saying  it  is  more 
environment-friendly.  
• Double  stack  vs  single  stack: The project has adopted different technical standards for 
WDFC and EDFC. WDFC would have moving dimensions made for double stacked containers 
and moving dimensions for EDFC are being made for single stack container operations. This 
makes seamless movement of double stack trains from WDFC to EDFC impossible.

Student Notes: 
• Not enough bidders: Given the conditions set by the Japanese government (which is giving 
soft loans) and which stipulates involvement of a Japanese partner, the total number of 
bidders has been low for the Western corridor. 
• Cancelled Tenders: Cancellation of a tender and iterating the process again have a ripple 
effect on the overall advancement of the project. 
How can DFCs help in reviving the manufacturing sector: 
• Dedicated  Freight  Corridors  are  proposed  to  adopt  world  class  and  state-of-the-art 
technology.  Significant  improvement  is  proposed  to  be  made  in  the  existing  carrying 
capacity by modifying basic design features. Both these improvements will allow longer and 
heavier trains to ply on the Dedicated Freight Corridors. This will provide infrastructure to 
allow heavy loaded trains to move.  
• Its completion will have a major impact on improving transportation infrastructure which 
will  enhance  attractiveness  of  India  as  an  investment  destination  including  the 
manufacturing sector 
• The time taken would be considerably, thereby reducing the shipping time. 
• It would also introduce time tabled freight services and guaranteed transit time 
• Once completed, the dedicated freight corridors will enable Indian Railways to improve its 
customer orientation and meet market needs more effectively thereby affecting the entire 
business ecosystem.  
• Unlike the existing rail network, which runs on a combination of diesel and electrical 
locomotives, the proposed DFC corridor will operate entirely through electric locomotives, 
thereby  lowering  the  transportation  costs  for  the  manufacturing  sector  which  are 
considerably higher when compared to developed countries of the world.  
4.2.4.	Rail	Development	Authority	
Government has approved the constitution of Rail Development Authority (RDA) in April, 2017. 
The role/mandate of RDA inter-alia includes providing expert advice to Government to make 
informed decision on:- 
1. Pricing of services commensurate with costs; 
2. Measures for enhancement of non-fare Revenue; 
3. Protection of consumer interests, by ensuring quality of service and cost optimization; 
4. Promoting competition, efficiency and economy; 
5. Encouraging market development and participation of  stakeholders in the rail sector and 
for ensuring a fair deal to the stakeholders and customers; 
6. Creating positive environment for investment; 
7. Promoting efficient allocation of resources in the Sector; 
8. Benchmarking of service standards against international norms and specify and enforce 
standards with respect to the quality, continuity and reliability of services provided them; 
9. Providing framework for non-discriminatory open access to the Dedicated Freight Corridor 
(DFC) infrastructure and others in future; 
10. Suggesting  measures  to  absorb  new  technologies  for  achieving  desired  efficiency  and 
performance standards; and  
11. Suggesting  measures  for  human  resource  development  to  achieve  any  of  its  stated 
objectives. 
4.2.5.	Safety	
The Indian Railways made safety its foremost priority and achieved its best ever (in last 57 
years) safety record in 2018-19. During 2018-19, consequential train accidents decreased from 
73 to 59 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year 
• Incident of train collisions has come down to zero in the year 2018-19.  
• The incidents of derailment have decreased from 78 in 2016- 17 to 46 in the year 2018-19.

Student Notes: 
• There has been an 81% drop in the number of deaths from 152 in 2013-14 to 29 till January 
31, 2019.  
• All unmanned level crossings on broad gauge network have been eliminated. 
Steps taken by the Government  
• Strong  acceleration  in  track  renewal  related  works- To eliminate track infirmities and to 
quickly replace old/damaged rail tracks, track renewal projects were prioritised. As a result, 
the speed of track renewal almost doubled from about 2,400 track km in 2014-15 to around 
4400 track kms in 2017-18.  
• Modernisation  of  track  and  rolling  stock  monitoring  and  maintenance- To  ensure  that 
defects in track or rolling stock are detected and addressed.  
• De-congesting  railway  network  and  upgrading  rolling  stock  technology- the government 
increased the average pace of commissioning new lines from an average of about 4.1 km 
per day (2009-14) to 6.5 km per day (2014-18). It is also upgrading the existing rolling stock 
by shifting to new technology such as LHB coaches and gradually procuring state-of-the-art 
diesel and electric locomotives.  
• Increased pace of elimination of unmanned level crossings- which was close to 1,140 per 
year during 2009- 14 was improved to about 3,400 unmanned level crossings in just 7 
months (April 2018 – October 2018).  
• Ensuring  adequate  funds- The Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh fund has been created for 
safety expenditure, which provides Indian Railways a dedicated corpus of `1 lakh crore for 
investing in safety projects during the 5 year period 2017 to 2022.  
• Other  measures- introduction  of  state-of-the-art  signaling  technology  (European  Train 
Control System (ETCS) level 2), proliferation of electronic interlocking, increased provision 
of foot over bridges, escalators, lifts in stations, filling safety related vacancies on priority. 
4.2.6.	Other	recent	initiatives	and	developments	
• In September 2020, the Indian Railways announced the ‘Clone  Train  Scheme’, wherein it 
planned to run a clone train with the train of the same number, to help and provide relief to 
the waitlisted passengers over heavy passenger traffic routes. 
• In September, 2020, Indian Railways sanctioned a feasibility study for seven bullet train 
projects - all open to PPP investments. 
• In July 2020, The Ministry of Railways decided to create a special cell, Project Development 
Cell  (PDC),  in  the  railway  board  to  increase  investments  and  inflow  of  foreign  direct 
investment (FDI). 
• In  November  2019,  Indian  Railways  entered  into  Procurement  cum  Maintenance 
Agreement with Madhepura Electric Locomotive Pvt. Ltd. (MELPL), a joint venture of Indian 
Railways and France-based Alstom to manufacture 800 electric locomotives for freight 
service and its associated maintenance. 
• In October 2019, Indian Railway launched One Touch ATVM for fast ticketing at 42 Suburban 
Stations of Central Railway. 
• The Government is going to come up with a ‘National Rail Plan’ to enable the country to 
integrate its  rail  network  with  other  modes  of  transport  and  develop  a  multi-modal 
transportation network.

Student Notes: 
more revenue. At the same time, we need to maintain and upgrade the existing network to 
ensure that supply keeps up with demand. 
•
 Ease  organizational  rigidity  through  structural  reforms: Consider  opening  up  the 
ownership and operations of freight terminals and ownership of locomotives and rolling 
stock to the private sector under a transparent, neutral (nonrailway) and fair regulatory 
mechanism. This will improve performance and attract private players and investments.  
o Consider  transferring  coach  and  locomotive  manufacturing  and  repairs  to  private 
players. However, since human safety is involved in the case of coaches and wagons, IR 
should continue to have regulatory and technical control over their manufacture and 
maintenance to ensure the safety of users in compliance with the General Rules of IR.  
o Separate suburban passenger transport from the rest of the network and put a light rail 
network in place in all major urban areas under local governments. 
•
 Rationalize fare structures and subsidies, and monetize assets to generate revenues:  
o Revisit IR’s pricing model to make the passenger and freight segments sustainable. 
Freight tariffs should be competitive with the cost of road transportation. 
o Monetize land resources with the railways, particularly through developing non-railway 
revenues such as through retail or other activities.  
o Increase retail revenues from railway stations by investing in facilities, modernizing 
stations and contracting space to private players. 
•
 Enhance the  ease  of  doing  business: Set  up  an  independent  homologation  and 
standardization  agency  to  adopt  new  railway  technology  and  improve  the  speed  and 
reliability of the railway network 
o Complete by 2022-23 the commissioning of the remaining 55 of the 100 new freight 
terminals announced in the Rail Budget of 2016-17 under ‘Mission Hundred’. 
o Improve  terminal  efficiency  by  promoting  the  concept  of  ‘engine-on-load’  system, 
developing proper terminal layouts, adopting efficient operational practices, operating 
trains  endto-end,  and  using  proper  handling  methods/  systems  for  loading  and 
unloading operations 
4.3.1.	Recommendation	by	Various	Committees	for	Reforms	
4.3.1.1. Rakesh    Mohan    Committee    (National    Transport    Development    Policy 
Committee (NTPDC))  
The Government of India set up the NTDPC in the year 2010, under the chairmanship of Dr. 
Rakesh Mohan. The aim of NTDPC was to provide a long-term transport policy for the country 
up to the year 2029-30. 
• Increase in investment in railways from 0.4 per cent of GDP in 11
th
 plan to 0.8 per cent in 
12
th
 plan and 1.1 per cent in 13
th
 plan and beyond. 
• Separation of railways management and operations from the Government. The Ministry of 
Railways in the future should be limited to setting policies. A new Railways Regulatory 
Authority should be setup, which would be responsible for overall regulation including the 
setting of tariffs. The management and operations should be carried out by a corporatized 
entity, the Indian Railway Corporation (IRC) (to be setup as a statutory corporation). 
• Accounting system to be revamped into a company account format in line with the Indian 
GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). 
• Indian Railways should take steps to capture a significant share of the fast growing FMCG, 
Consumer Durable and Information Technology, containerized cargo and other segments 
like automobiles, etc, where its presence is negligible. 
• Strategy for passenger services should include augmentation of supply, shift of focus to long 
distance and inter-city transport, upgradation of speed and development of select High 
Speed Rail corridors.

• Improved  connectivity  to  industry  clusters  as  well  as  significant  ports,  based  on  their 
current and projected traffic volumes. 
• Development  of  15-20  logistics  parks  at  the  main  network  hubs  such  as  Mumbai, 
Bangalore, Delhi NCR etc. 
• Construction of six Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) on top priority. 
• Establishment of National Board for Rail Safety & Establishment of Railway Research and 
Development Council.  
• Setting up a National Railway Construction Authority, partially independent of Ministry of 
Railways, to expedite delivery of projects. 
• Multiple services and cadres of Railways at the management level need to be rationalized 
and coalesced into fewer services. 
• Indian Railways should expedite the execution and operationalization of identified inter-
connectivity projects. 
4.3.1.2. The Bibek Debroy Committee  
“Mobilization of Resources for Major Railway Projects and Restructuring of Railway Ministry 
and Railway Board” is the theme of the Report. The final Report was submitted in June, 2015 
and reviews almost all areas of Indian Railways operations. The key recommendations of this 
committee are as follows: 
• Transition  to  commercial  accounting: The financial statements of Indian Railways need to 
be re-drawn, consistent with principles and norms nationally and internationally accepted. 
• Streamline  recruitment  &  HR  processes: There  is  a  multiplicity  of  different  channels 
through which people enter the railway services. It essentially recommended unifying and 
streamlining the process. 
• Establishment  of  Independent  Regulator  RRAI:  setting  up  an  overarching  Railway 
Regulatory Authority of India (RRAI) as an independent regulatory body. The Railway Board 
should continue only as an entity for the Indian Railways (PSU). 
• Encouraging private entry: Private entry into running both freight and passenger trains in 
competition with Indian Railways should be allowed and private participation in various 
railway infrastructure services and non-core activities like production and construction, 
should be encouraged. 
• Indian Railway Manufacturing Company: The Committee proposes that all these existing 
production  units  whether  it  is  for  coaches  or  locomotives  should  be  placed  under  a 
government SPV known as the Indian Railway Manufacturing Company (IRMC). 
• Raising resources: An Investment Advisory Committee may be set up, consisting of experts, 
investment bankers and representatives of SEBI, RBI, IDFC and other institutions for raising 
resources for investment. 
• Social costs & JVs to bear them: Constructing new suburban lines should be undertaken as 
joint ventures with state governments. There are too many Zones and Divisions and thus a 
rationalization exercise is required. 
• Changing relationship between government & Railways: A separate Railway budget should 
be phased out progressively and merged with the General Budget. 
• Decentralisation: Decentralisation should happen at the bottom level duties. 
• Non- core  areas: Separation of activities like running of hospitals, schools, catering, real 
estate development, manufacturing of locomotives, coaches and wagons from the core 
business of running trains. 
Clearly, the panel has articulated a very far sighted report with major changes that will take 
time for completion. Many recommendations of this committee has already been undertaken 
by the government.

5.	Civil	Aviation	
India  is  the  third  largest  domestic  market  for  civil  aviation  in  the  world.  India  has  136 
commercially-managed airports by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and 6 under PublicPrivate 
Partnerships  (PPP)  for  Operation,  Maintenance  and  Development  of  airports. The Airports 
Authority of India (AAI) aims to bring around 250 airports under operation across the country 
by 2020.  
The civil aviation sector contributed USD 8.9 billion to India’s GDP in 2014 and supported 1.31 
million direct, indirect and induced aviation jobs. In 2016, the demand for domestic air travel 
was twice that in China. India’s domestic air traffic made up 69 per cent of total airline traffic in 
South Asia. 
The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, 2018 ranks India as 53rd out of 
140 countries worldwide in air transport infrastructure.  
India’s civil aviation sector has been growing steadily; the number  of  passengers was 158 
million in 2016-17. Domestic passenger traffic increased at a CAGR of almost 10 per cent 
between 2007- 08 and 2016-17 and international passenger traffic grew at a CAGR of 8.07 per 
cent during the same period.  
The airline operators in India have scaled up their aircraft seat capacity from an estimated 0.07 
annual seats per capita in 2013 to 0.12 in 2018.  
India is also catching up with other leading aviation markets in terms of market penetration. 
There has been an increase in air cargo, both domestically and internationally, in 2016-17. IATA 
has forecast that India will cross over into the top 10 air freight markets in 2018-19. 
Currently, Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is the regulatory body in the field of civil 
aviation under the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Airport Authority of India is the PSU under the 
Ministry of Civil Aviation engaged in development and building of airport infrastructure & 
managing airports across the country.  
5.1.	Issues	
• Capacity  and  infrastructure: Due to the rapid expansion of India’s civil aviation sector, 
airspace, parking bays and runway slots will become increasingly scarce over the next few 
years, especially at metro airports. Mumbai and Chennai airports are already close to 
saturation. Capacity and infrastructure constraints could decrease efficiency and safety and 
have negative economic effects.  
o Inadequate hangar space and unavailability of land to expand airports at their current 
sites, particularly in major cities, are two of the major constraints that face the sector.  
• Lack of Skilled workers: According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, 
Indian aviation could directly support 1.0 to 1.2 million jobs by 2035. This implies that 
about 0.25 million persons will need to be skilled over the next 10 years.  
o Shortage and gaps in availability of industry-recognised skills – from airline pilots and 
crew to maintenance and ground handling personnel – could constrain the growth of 
different segments of the sector.  
o High price of Avgas (an imported fuel used by almost all training aircraft) coupled with a 
shortage  of  instructors,  makes  flying  training  an  expensive  and  time-consuming 
exercise. 
• High  cost  to  passengers  and  of  air  cargo: This is due to upgradation of infrastructure, 
expensive aviation turbine fuel, high GST incidence on aircraft engine and spare parts etc. 
• Aviation  safety:  Although,  the  number  of  aviation  safety  violations  in  2017  (337)  has 
declined in comparison to 2016 (442), the absolute number still remains high.

5.2.	Government	Initiatives	
5.2.1.	RCS	–	UDAN	(Regional	Connectivity	Scheme	–	Ude	Desh	ka	Aam	Nagrik)	
The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Government of India released the National Civil Aviation 
Policy  2016  (NCAP  2016).  One  of  the  objectives  of  NCAP  2016  is  to  “enhance  regional 
connectivity  through  fiscal  support  and  infrastructure  development”.  In  line  with  this, 
government launched UDAN scheme. 
The primary objective of RCS is to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity by making it 
affordable.  Promoting  affordability  of  regional  air  connectivity  is  envisioned  under  RCS  by 
supporting airline operators through  
(1) concessions by Central Government, State Governments (reference deemed to  include 
Union Territories as well, unless explicitly specified otherwise) and airport operators to reduce 
the cost of airline operations on regional routes / other support measures  
(2) financial (viability gap funding or VGF) support to meet the gap, if any, between the cost of 
airline operations and expected revenues 
Key features of the scheme 
• UDAN will be applicable on flights which cover between 200 km and 800 km with no lower 
limit set for hilly, remote, island and security sensitive regions.  
• The scheme seeks to reserve a minimum number of UDAN seats i.e. seats at subsidized 
rates and also cap the fare for short distance flights.  
• A Regional Connectivity Fund would be created to meet the VGF requirements under the 
scheme. The RCF levy per departure will be applied to certain domestic flights along with 
20% contribution from states.  
• For balanced regional growth, the allocations under the scheme would be equitably spread 
across the five geographical regions of the country viz. North, West, South, East and North-
east.  
• The scheme UDAN envisages providing connectivity to un-served and under-served airports 
of the country through revival of existing air-strips and airports.  
• The scheme would be in operation for a period of 10 years. 
Recently, Civil Aviation Ministry has approved 78 new routes under 4th round of Regional 
Connectivity Scheme (UDAN 4.0) to further enhance the connectivity to remote & regional 
areas of the country.  
• For the first time, helipads were also connected under phase 2 of UDAN scheme. 
• Key  Features  of  UDAN  3  included - Inclusion  of  Tourism  Routes  under  UDAN  3  in 
coordination with the Ministry of Tourism; Inclusion of Seaplanes for connecting Water 
Aerodromes, and, Bringing in a number of routes in the North-East Region under the ambit 
of UDAN. 
Significance  
• The scheme would ensure affordability, connectivity, growth and development.  
• This would help in generating employment.  
• It  provides  an  additional  business  opportunity  by  increasing  the  potential  for  moving 
existing perishable cargo, fragile goods and high-value export-oriented products by air.  
• The state governments would reap the benefit of development of remote areas, enhance 
trade  and  commerce  and  more  tourism  expansion  through  the  introduction  of  small 
aircrafts and helicopters.

Student Notes: 
Criticisms  
• Airlines represent luxury. In a poor country like India it seems a case of misplaced priorities 
when governments and passengers have to bear the cost of additional subsidies to connect 
regional air routes.  
• India is the fastest growing aviation market in terms of passenger traffic. State subsidies, 
therefore, are best used elsewhere.  
• The assumption that three years would be enough to make a route sustainable might be 
misplaced.  It  does  not  take  into  account  a  scenario  of  fuel  cost  increase  that  would 
significantly change the air cost dynamics. 
5.2.2.	National	Civil	Aviation	Policy	(NCAP	2016)		
The Union Cabinet recently cleared the Civil Aviation Policy in order to boost the domestic 
aviation sector and provide passenger-friendly fares. This new policy aims at providing various 
benefits to domestic airline passengers. 
Aim of the Policy 
• India to become 3rd largest civil aviation market by 2022 from 9th. 
• Domestic ticketing to grow from 8 crore in 2015 to 30 crore by 2022. To grow domestic 
passenger traffic nearly four-fold to 300 million by 2022. 
• Airports having scheduled commercial flights to increase from 77 in 2016 to 127 by 2019. 
• Cargo volumes to increase by 4 times to 10 million tonnes by 2027. 
• Enhancing  ease  of  doing  business  through  deregulation,  simplified  procedures  and  e-
governance. 
• Promoting ‘Make In India’ in the Civil Aviation Sector. 
• Ensuring availability of quality certified 3.3 lakh skilled personnel by 2025. 
Highlights of NCAP 
• Regional Connectivity Scheme 
o Capping of fare: Rs 1,200 for 30 minutes and Rs 2,500 for hour-long flights. 
o Revival of airstrips/airports as No-Frills Airports at an indicative cost of Rs. 50 crore to 
Rs. 100 crore. 
• Route  Dispersal  Guidelines  (RDG): MoCA  will  categorize  the  air  traffic  routes  into  3   
categories. 
• 5/20 rule scrapped 
o Replaced with a scheme which provides a level playing field. 
o All airlines can now commence international operations provided that they deploy 20 
aircraft or 20% of total capacity, whichever is higher for domestic operations. 
• Bilateral Traffic Rights: Government of India will enter into 'Open Sky' ASA on a reciprocal 
basis with SAARC countries and countries located beyond 5,000 km from Delhi. i.e. these 
countries will have unlimited access, in terms of number of flights and seats, to Indian 
airports, leading to increased flight frequencies. 
• Ease of Doing Business 
o A single window for all aviation related transactions, complaints, etc. 
o More focus on ease-of-doing business as government plans to liberalize regime of 
regional flights. 
• Infrastructure Development 
o Restoration of air strips at a maximum cost of Rs. 50 crore through Airports Authority 
of India (AAI). 
o Four  Heli-hubs  to  be  developed.  Helicopter  Emergency  Medical  Services  to  be 
facilitated. 
o Development of Greenfield and Brownfield airports by State governments, private 
sector or in PPP mode to be encouraged.

Student Notes: 
• Future tariffs at all airports will be calculated on a 'hybrid till' basis. Under ‘hybrid till’, only 
up to 30 per cent of the non-aeronautical revenues, which include segments like retail, food 
& beverages and parking, would be used for cross-subsidisation of aeronautical charges. 
5.3.	Way	Ahead	
•
 Enhance aviation infrastructure: Complete the planned airports under the UDAN initiative 
in a time-bound manner. Revival of 50 un-served and under-served airports/airstrips should 
be completed. In addition to completing two new airports for Delhi and Mumbai by 2022, 
the  infrastructure  capacity  in  the  10  biggest  airports  (in  terms  of  traffic)  should  be 
significantly augmented. 
•
 Increase  investment  in  the  sector  through  financial  and  infrastructure  support: Create 
additional  parking  hubs  at suitable  locations,  accessible  through  short  haul  flights,  to 
accommodate additional aircraft. Monetize vacant real estate near AAI airports in all major 
centres of traffic to increase non-aeronautical revenues. 
•
 Address shortage of skilled manpower: Promote collaboration between original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs), industry and educational institutes to teach the latest concepts in 
the aviation industry including management principles, IT in aviation, etc.  
o Expedite  commencement  of  courses  by  the  National  Aviation  University  after  due 
consultation with stakeholders.  
o Facilitate greater involvement of the private sector in sponsoring aviation institutions, 
industrial training and R&D projects.  
o A further reduction in GST rates on Avgas will allow flying training organizations to 
make training more affordable 
•
 Promote air-cargo growth: Develop an integrated digital supply chain or e-cargo gateway 
based on the National Air Cargo Community System (NACCS) platform and promote “Fly-
from-India” through the creation of transhipment hubs. 
•
 Ease the regulatory environment for airports: Deregulate further and open up the aviation 
market to help increase passenger and freight traffic in India.  
o Adopt a consistent model for tariff determination so that it reduces passenger cost.  
o Amend the AAI Act to allow commercial usage of land with airports by liberalising end-
use restrictions for existing and future airports.  
o Ensure that the DGCA acts as a truly independent regulator, with the Ministry of Civil 
Aviation focusing on policies.  
o Meet the regulatory and security requirements prescribed by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO) at all times.  
•
 Prioritize aviation safety: There should be zero tolerance of safety violations. DGCA should 
be given autonomy for an effective aviation safety oversight system. It should also be 
authorized to impose fines and penalties depending upon the nature of violations. DGCA 
should create a single-window system for all aviation related transactions, queries and 
complaints 
•
 State governments should play a much more active role in the airport sector since aviation 
is a key enabler of local economic development. 
• Conditions  should  be  created  that allow  Indian  MRO  (Maintenance  Repairs  and 
Overhaul/Operations) industry to grow rapidly. India has strong comparative advantages 
to become a world-leading centre of MRO. 
6.	Ports	and	Shipping	
Shipping is essential to both commodity and services trade of any country. India has a coastline 
spanning about 7,500 km. Around 95 per cent of India’s trade by volume and 68 per cent in 
terms of value is transported by sea.

Student Notes: 
As on 30th September, 2019, India 
had a fleet strength of 1,419 ships 
(Figure  21).  Despite  one  of  the 
largest  merchant  shipping  fleet 
among developing countries, India’s 
share  in  total  world  dead  weight 
tonnage (DWT) is only 0.9 per cent 
as on January 1, 2019 according to 
Institute of Shipping Economics and 
Logistics. The existing Indian fleet is 
also  aging,  with  the  average  age 
increasing from 15 years in 1999 to 
19.71 years as on October 1, 2019. 
Ministry  of  Shipping  has  been  striving  to  improve  the  operational  efficiencies  through 
mechanization, digitization and process simplification. As a result key efficiency parameters 
have improved considerably. 
• The Average Turnaround Time in 2018-19 improved to 59.51 Hrs as against 64.43 Hrs in 
2017-18.  
• The Average Output Per Ship Berthday has increased from 15,333 Tonnes in 2017-18 to 
16541 Tonnes in 2018-19 
 
In keeping with general policy of economic liberalisation, the port sector was opened to private 
sector participation in 1997. Accordingly, a regulatory body known as Tariff Authority for Major 
Ports (TAMP) was introduced for regulating both vessel-related and cargo-related tariffs. TAMP 
was also made responsible for regulating rates for lease of properties in respect of major port 
trusts and private operators. Currently 100% FDI is allowed in the shipping sector in India. 
Inland waterways 
Inland Water Transport (IWT) carries less than 2 per cent of India’s organized freight traffic and 
negligible passenger traffic.

Student Notes: 
 
The  Inland  Waterways  Authority  of  India  (IWAI)  is  mandated  to  develop  and  maintain 
infrastructure for fairway, navigational aids and terminals. The IWAI also provides an enabling 
environment for private investment in cargo vessels and operational services. Until 2015, there 
were only five NWs in the country. In April 2016, 106 more waterways spread over 24 states 
were declared as NWs.  
6.1.	Issues	
• Modal mix: Roads (54 per cent) continue to be the dominant mode of transporting cargo, 
followed by rail (33 per cent). Transportation of cargo through waterways – shipping and 
inland water – accounts for a minuscule modal share (6 per cent) despite it being the most 
costeffective and efficient mode.  
• Draught  levels: Most Indian container handling ports lack the capability to handle large 
container vessels due to inadequate depth; a minimum draft depth of 18 metres is needed 
to enable mother vessels to dock at ports. With international trade leaning towards the 
more economically viable mother vessels, shallow draft adversely affects a port’s potential 
to become a hub port.  
• Poor performance of Government ports: It takes up to four times as long to fill or unload a 
cargo ship at Jawaharlal Nehru Port than at private rival. Most of the major ports are 
overstaffed with unskilled and untrained labour and the development of such ports may 
suffer due to frequent labour strikes, inefficiency and low labour productivity. 
• Procedural  and  policy  related  challenges: The presence of a dual institutional structure 
that has led to the development of major ports (those owned by the central government) 
and non-major ports (those owned by the state governments) as individual projects. The 
involvement  of  multiple  agencies  in  the  development  of  infrastructure  to  promote 
industrialization, trade, tourism and transportation across the country is another deterrent. 
• Connectivity  to  ports:  Weak  hinterland  connectivity  between  production  centres  and 
gateway ports often leads to higher costs and delays because of sub-optimal mode choices.  
• Transhipment  port: A large percentage of containers in India are currently transhipped 
through other ports, such as Colombo (just south of India), Singapore (East), Dubai and 
Salalah (West) due to the absence of a transhipment port in the country. This has led to 
additional costs and delays due to the feeder voyage from India to the hub port.  
• Less  Private  participation: The financial viability of port projects is a major deterrent for 
private developers as well as financiers. Greenfield port projects are usually in remote 
locations  and  considerable  government  level  support  is  required  to  create  basic 
infrastructure for site access. 
• Charges by the shipping lines: The business practices of shipping lines have played a key 
role in the present negative perception of sea transport. A long pending concern has been 
the high rate and multiplicity of charges imposed by shipping lines.

Student Notes: 
• Capital for inland vessels: At present, the cost of capital is very high and makes IWT freight 
uncompetitive. It is difficult to attract capital for building inland vessels as it is a significant 
investment.  
• Technical  issues  in  inland  waterways: The  varying  and  limited  depths  due  to  the 
meandering and braiding of alluvial rivers and the erosion of their banks causing excessive 
siltation, lack of cargo earmarked for IWT, non-mechanized navigation lock systems and 
insufficient unloading facility at terminals hinder the use of IWT by shippers.  
• Regulatory  issues  for  inland  waterways: States’ Ferries Acts from various years govern 
cross ferry movement and this may present a barrier to inland navigation, as the regulations 
may not take into account safety considerations. 
• Severe  shortage  of  MRO (Maintenance, Repair and overhaul) facilities for inland water 
transport vessels.  
6.2.	Government	Initiatives	
6.2.1.	Sagar	Mala	Project	
The Ministry of Shipping’s Sagarmala programme focuses on modernizing and developing ports, 
enhancing  port  connectivity,  supporting  coastal  communities  and  stimulating  port-linked 
industrialization. It aims to promote port-led direct and indirect development and to provide 
infrastructure to transport goods to and from ports quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. 
• Sagarmala aims to reduce the logistics costs for foreign and domestic trade, leading to an 
overall cost savings of INR 35,000 to INR 40,000 crore annually by 2025.  
• It also aims to double the share of water transportation in the modal mix.  
The government has set up the Sagarmala Development Company Limited (SDCL) to provide 
funding support to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) set up to implement projects and the Indian 
Port  Rail  Corporation  Limited  (IPRCL)  to  undertake  port-rail  connectivity  projects  under 
Sagarmala. 
 
How port led development can help India?  
• Development  of  port  infrastructure: It would enhance port connectivity, modernisation 
and port-linked industrialisation.  
• Benefiting to Coastal communities: It would lead to development of coastal communities. 
With 42 per cent of India’s population living in the coastal states, it can make a positive 
impact on the lives of more than 500 million people.

Student Notes: 
• Inland  waterways: The programme like Sagarmala for port led development would have 
large impact on hinterland states also, through the development of 111 inland waterways.  
o Jal Marg Vikas Project is expected to benefit densely populated states of Uttar Pradesh, 
Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal through the development of national waterways-1. 
• Tourism: Multiple cruise tourism centers have been launched including in Mumbai, Chennai 
and Cochin. These would provide a significant boost to the tourism industry in India.  
• Export and Import: Indian ports handle more than 90 per cent of India’s total EXIM trade 
volume. Port led development is critical to boost India’s exports and imports.  
• Easy  movement of  cargo: By linking major and non-major ports, industrial clusters and 
evacuation  infrastructure  into  a  single  system  at  a  larger  regional  level,  it  will  enable 
seamless and efficient movement of cargo through gateways, thereby allowing ports to 
enhance competitiveness and offer multiple freight options to customers.  
• Decreasing Logistics Costs and enabler of ‘Make in India’: Logistics costs have a crucial role 
to play in international trade. By making transport water-based, we can reduce our logistics 
costs, which in India is between 16-18 per cent, but in the next two-three years, through 
the successful execution of Sagarmala and Bharatmala programme, it is expected to come 
down to match the global average. 
6.2.1.1. Coastal Economic Zone 
14  mega  CEZs  is proposed  to  be  established  under  the  Sagarmala  Programme.  It  is 
conceptualised as a spatial-economic region which could extend along 300-500 km of coastline 
and around 200-300 km inland from the coastline. Each CEZ will be an agglomeration of coastal 
districts within a State. The concept is based in China based Shenzhenstyle Coastal Economic 
Zone.  
• It will provide the geographical boundary within which port led industrialization will be 
developed by having a uniform policy along the ports and coastal states.  
• The CEZs have been envisaged to tap synergies with the planned industrial corridors like 
Vizag Chennai Industrial Corridor and Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor.  
• Under CEZ investors will get business friendly ecosystem including ease of doing business, 
especially ease of exporting and importing, swift decisions for environmental clearances 
etc. 
• It would help in boosting exports, employment and foreign investment. 
6.2.1.2. Model Concession Agreement for Port Development 
Union Cabinet approved changes in the model concession agreement (MCA) for public-private 
partnership projects (PPP) in major ports conceived under Sagarmala programme. 
Key Provisions of Revised MCA  
• It provides an exit  route  to  developers where they can divest their equity up to 100 per 
cent after completion of two years from the Commercial Operation Date (COD).  
• The royalty to the developer will be charged on basis of per million tonne of cargo handled 
and will be linked to wholesale price index thus reducing discretion of tariff setting by 
TAMP.  
• Land rent has been reduced from 200% to 120% for additional land.  
• MCA envisage constitution of the Society  for Affordable  Redressal  of  Disputes - Ports 
(SAROD-PORTS) as dispute resolution mechanism.  
• The  concessionaire  would  be  free  to  deploy higher  capacity  equipment,  facilities, 
technology and carry out value engineering for higher productivity and cost saving.  
• New definition of "Change in Law" to provide for compensation to concessionaire in case 
of changes in TAMP guidelines, labour laws or environmental laws.  
• A complaint portal for port users and a monitoring arrangement has also been introduced 
for keeping periodical status report of the project.

Student Notes: 
Implications  
• The revised Model Concession Agreement will attract investment for port development.  
• Easier exit norms will simplify the route for mergers and acquisitions in Port sector.  
• It will also result in better utilisation of physical assets by private developers as they can 
start operations before getting all certifications.  
• It will also bring the provisions of MCA in line with Major Ports Authority Bill, 2016 which 
had provided that concessionaire will be free to fix the actual tariffs based on market 
conditions. 
6.2.2.	The	Major	Port	Authorities	Bill	2020	
Lok  Sabha  recently  passed  The  Major  Port  Authorities  Bill  2020  that  sought  to  provide 
autonomy to India’s major ports and improve their efficiency and competitiveness. The Bill will 
replace the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 and seeks to provide for regulation, operation and 
planning of Major Ports in India. It shall apply to the Major Ports of Chennai, Cochin, Deendayal 
(Kandla),  Jawaharlal  Nehru  (Nhava  Sheva),  Kolkata,  Mormugao,  Mumbai,  New  Mangalore, 
Paradip, V.O. Chidambaranar (Tuticorin) and Visakhapatnam. 
Key provisions 
• Creation  of  Major  Port  Authorities  Board:  It  vests  the  administration,  control  and 
management of such ports upon the Major Port Authorities Board. These Boards will 
replace the existing Port Trusts.  
• Powers  of  the  Board: The Boards of Port Authority have been delegated full powers to 
enter into contracts, planning and development, fixing of tariff except in national interest, 
security and emergency arising out of inaction and default.  
• Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects: The Bill defines PPP projects as projects taken up 
through a concession contract by the Board. For such projects, the Board may fix the tariff 
for the initial bidding purposes.  
• Landlord model: It will reorient the governance model in central ports to landlord model, 
whereby  port  infrastructure  is  leased  to  private  operators  but  ownership  of  the  port 
remains with port authority.  
• Constitution of Adjudicatory Board by the central government: This Board will replace the 
existing Tariff Authority for Major Ports constituted under the 1963 Act. Currently, the Tariff 
Authority for Major Ports (TAMP), established under the 1963 Act, fixes the scale of rates 
for assets and services available at ports.  
o The role of TAMP has been redefined in the bill. The port authority has now been given 
powers to fix tariffs which will act as a reference tariff for purposes of bidding for PPP 
projects. PPP operators will be free to fix tariffs based on market conditions. 
Significance of the bill  
• Decentralize decision making: The bill aims at decentralizing decision making and to infuse 
professionalism  in  governance  of  major  ports.  This  will  empower  the  Major  Ports  to 
perform with greater efficiency on account of full autonomy in decision making and by 
modernizing the institutional framework of Major Ports. A compact Board with professional 
independent Members will strengthen decision making and strategic planning.  
• Transparency: The bill is expected to help impart faster and transparent decision making 
benefiting the stakeholders and better project execution capability.  
• Attract  private  investment: It would aid the major ports in being more competitive and 
nimble in the market vis-a-vis non-major ports and also boost their ability to attract more 
private sector investments in the medium to long term.  
• World class infrastructure: The bill will help the ports develop world class infrastructure. It 
can make India's major ports compete with major world class ports.

6.2.3.	Vadhavan	Port	
The Union Cabinet has given its 'in-principle' approval for setting up a Major Port at Vadhavan, 
located about190 km north of JNPT in Maharashtra. An SPV will be formed with Jawaharlal 
Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) as the lead partner with equity participation equal to or more than 50% 
to implement the project. 
The port site at Vadhavan has an 18m draft naturally available and a 20m navigational channel 
also naturally available. The two largest container ports of the country, JNPT and Mundra, have 
drafts of 15m and 16m, respectively, whereas the world’s largest container-handling modern 
deep draft ports require a draft of at least 18-20m. 
Significance of the Vadhavan port 
• With  development  of  the  Vadhavan  port, India  will  break  into  countries  with  top  10 
container ports in the world. 
• Development  of  this  port  will  enable  cargo  container  vessels  of  16,000-25,000  TEUs 
capacity, giving advantage of economies of scale and reducing logistics cost. 
• It will also cater to the spill over traffic from JNPT port once its planned capacity of 10 
million TEUs is fully utilized. 
6.2.4.	For	inland	waterways	
• The ministry is augmenting the capacity of NW-l under the Jal  Marg  Vikas  project. The 
project  will  enable  the  movement  of  larger  vessels  of  1,500-2,000  tonnes  on  inland 
waterways.  
• Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility conducted for 106 new NWs, 20 NWs 
have been found to be technically viable and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) have been 
prepared. Development activities have been initiated on 10 viable NWs 
• To provide institutional funding, the Government has proposed to allocate 2.5 per cent of 
the  proceeds  of  Central  Road  Fund  (CRF) for development and maintenance of National 
Waterways. The CRF has since been renamed the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund. 
• In order to reduce the logistics cost of cargo and facilitate passenger movement between 
North East and mainland, MOUs have been signed with Bangladesh. 
6.2.5.	Other	initiatives	
• Project  Unnati:  An  exercise  was  undertaken  to  prepare  a  Quantitative  Benchmarking 
Module which covered the operational, financial, human resources and efficiency related 
parameters for benchmarking of efficiency and productivity of Major Ports in India against 
international standards and define Key Performance Indicators for the ports and terminals. 
o A total number of 116 new initiatives for 12 Major Ports were identified under Project 
Unnati to increase the volume of traffic significantly and also avoidance of capital 
expenditure, out of which 95 has already been completed. 
• India, one of the world’s five major ship recycling countries, has acceded to the IMO Hong 
Kong  International  Convention,  the  treaty  that  will  set  global  standards  for  safe  and 
environmentally-sound ship recycling. 
• India has become the first country in the world to issue a Biometric  Seafarer  Identity 
Document (BSID), capturing the facial biometric data of seafarers. The BSID introduces new 
security features, including an embedded biometric chip. 
6.3.	Way	ahead	
• Open up India’s dredging market: The government needs to open up the dredging market 
to attract more players, particularly international players, in dredging activities to increase 
and maintain draft depth at ports to attract large vessels and enable them to become hub 
ports. At present, the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) and a limited set of private 
vendors serve the Indian dredging market, limiting competition.

Student Notes: 
• Expedite  the  implementation  of  Sagarmala: Expedite the completion of various projects 
under Sagarmala, especially those aimed at improving port connectivity, setting up coastal 
economic zones (CEZs) and establishing new ports 
• Ease  the  business  environment  around  shipping  and  ports: The Government of India 
needs to take a fresh look at its policy of imports on a ‘’Free on Board” basis (FoB policy) as 
it needs to balance risk between the importer and exporter.  
o Enhance technology use in ports and, wherever feasible, draw lessons from successful 
global ports such as Rotterdam, Felixstowe and Singapore to improve efficiency. 
o Given the inadequate capacity of the Indian coastal fleet and the need for growth in 
containerization, we should consider further relaxing cabotage laws at least until the 
coastal shipping sector expands to meet existing demand. 
• The new Merchant Shipping Bill to replace the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, needs to be 
enacted at the earliest to promote the ease of doing business, transparency and effective 
delivery of services. Opening up of the sector will improve the availability of ships and help 
reduce costs. 
• For inland waterways 
o IWT should be integrated to multimodal/ intermodal connectivity. Inland terminals with 
proper road and/or rail connectivity and seamless transfer of goods from one mode to 
the other are important for an efficient logistics supply chain. 
o Financing for inland vessels could be made part of priority sector lending by banks. 
Categorizing inland vessels as infrastructure equipment will further ease access to 
capital issues for a sector where capital investments and operational costs are high. 
Initially, viability gap funding can be given at least for 10 years until the infrastructure is 
fully developed, so that inland water transport is competitive. 
o From a regulatory standpoint, detention of a vessel without a valid reason should not 
be allowed. Moreover currently, inland waterways are governed by multiple authorities 
including the Central Inland Water Corporation Limited (CIWTC Ltd), port authorities 
and  state  governments.  Streamlining  the  regulatory  structure  and  bringing  an 
overarching body to oversee Inland Water Transport such as the IWAI will bring more 
consistency in the rules and strategy of the sector. 
o A clear directive needs to be issued for security of inland vessels, crew and cargo. 
7.	Telecommunications	
Telecommunications has evolved as a basic infrastructure like electricity, roads, water etc. and 
has also emerged as one of the critical components of economic growth required for overall 
socio-economic  development  of  the  country.  The  Indian  telecom  sector  has  registered  a 
phenomenal growth during the past few years and has become the second largest telephone 
network in the world, only after China.

Student Notes: 
Total telephone connections in India grew by 18.8 per cent from 9,961 lakh in 2014-2015 to 
11,834 lakh in 2018-19.  
• The wireless telephony now constitutes 98.27 per cent of all subscriptions whereas share of 
landline telephones now stands at only 1.73 per cent.  
• Tele-density, which shows the number of telephones per 100 people, is an important 
indicator of telecom penetration in the country.  
o The overall tele-density in India stands at 90.45 per cent, the rural tele-density being 
57.35 per cent and urban teledensity being 160.71 per cent at the end of September 
2019.  
• The private sector dominates with a share of 88.81 per cent (10,606 lakh connections). 
Government has taken many initiatives for development of this sector 
• Bringing in transparency in the allocation of spectrum by adopting an auction process.  
• Government  is  supporting  research  and  study  in 5G through  financial  assistance  to 
institutions of national importance.  
• Full Mobile Number Portability (MNP)- One Nation Full Mobile Number Portability (MNP) 
was allowed recently.  
• Government has also decided to merge  the  two  loss-making  telecom  PSUs  BSNL  and 
MTNL as part of their revival package. The reasons for losses include high employee costs, 
Cheap mobile/internet connections to politicians and government employees, Absence of 
4G services except in a few circles eroding competitiveness etc. 
• Re-designation of the 'Telecom Commission' as the 'Digital Communications Commission' 
• In March 2020, the government approved the Production Incentive Scheme for Large- scale 
Electronics  Manufacturing.  The  scheme  proposes  production-linked  incentive  to  boost 
domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in mobile phone manufacturing and 
specified  electronic  components  including  Assembly,  Testing,  Marking  and  Packaging 
(ATMP) units. 
Challenges being faced by Indian Telecom sector  
• Tariff  war- The price of data is at an average of Rs 8 per GB, which is one of the lowest in 
the  world  and  calling  service  has  also  been  made  virtually  free.  So,  monthly  average 
revenue per user (ARPU) has plunged to Rs 113 in FY19 from Rs 174 in FY15. 
• Low level of capital expenditure because of cut-throat competition in the sector, the sector 
is short of around 7 lakh crore investment that is needed to provide qualities as promised 
by 4G technology.  
• Large debts- telecom sector is under a debt of around Rs. 4 lakh crores because of various 
investment related and other activities.  
• Limited  Spectrum  Availability - government auction spectrum at an exorbitant cost and 
hence the available spectrum is less than 40% as compared to European nations and 50% as 
compared to China.  
• Import  dependence- India  imports  around  40  billion  dollars  of  telecom  equipment 
including infrastructure to setup 5G technology.  
• Over  the  top  services- Over the Top (OTT) applications such as WhatsApp hampers the 
revenue of telecommunication service provider.  
• High  regulatory  dues- spectrum  liabilities,  penalties,  interests  etc.  further  add  to  the 
burden.  
• High taxes- taxes and levies in the Indian telecom sector, ranging from 29% to 32%, are one 
of the highest globally. 
Measures needed 
• Curb on predatory pricing- government should fix a ‘floor tariff’ to save the industry from 
price war.

Student Notes: 
• Reduce reserve price for spectrum auction- government should refrain from putting high 
hopes of revenue generation from spectrum auction as it affects the sector badly.  
• Self-reliance on technology- India would do well to spend on import of technology rather 
than equipment which will improve Make in India and will have a multiplier effect on the 
sector in long run.  
• Infrastructure sharing between telecoms- BSNL can share its infrastructure for the use of 
private sector which will create revenue for BSNL as well as reduce investment load on 
private sector.  
• Value  addition  in  services- Internet  services  can  be  clubbed  with  services  like 
entertainment, e-education, telemedicine etc. which can lead to more revenue generation 
for the sector.  
• Short- and  long-term  relief  measures in the form of relaxation of interests accrued or 
longer repayment periods are needed. 
7.1.	National	Telecom	Policy	2018	
To provide for world-class telecommunications infrastructure for rapid socioeconomic growth of 
the country, the Government has been announcing its telecom policy statements on a regular 
interval since the liberalization of early 1990s. There had been four National Telecom Policy 
statements earlier in 1994, 1999, 2004 and 2012.  
Need for new Telecom Policy in 2018  
• To restructure regulatory and licensing frameworks, to account for the transformations in 
the Telecom sector since the NTP 2012  
• To  leverage  the  convergence  of  voice,  video  and  data  services,  especially  to  spur  the 
socioeconomic development up to the bottom of the pyramid  
• To  account  for  the  Industrial  Revolution  4.0  build  around  the  Iot,  M2M  and  AI  bringing 
together digital, biological and physical technologies in powerful combinations  
• To provide reliable and secured data connectivity for all with assured quality of service  
• To facilitate development of infrastructure and services for new technologies including 5G 
and IoT  
• To encourage innovation and manufacturing  
• To develop a large pool of digitally skilled man-power  
National Telecom Policy 2018 is also referred to as National  Digital  Communications  Policy 
(NDCP), 2018. The policy would set the mission and objectives to be accomplished by the end 
of calendar year 2022, when India will be celebrating its 75 years of independence  
• The policy has envisaged attracting investments worth US$ 100 billion in the sector by 2022

Student Notes: 
enhance  the  Government’s  capacity  to  deliver  critical  services  like  health,  banking  and 
commerce to all of its citizens.   
The number of internet subscribers (both broadband and narrowband put together) stood at 
6,653 lakh at the end of June 2019 as compared to 2,516 lakh in 2014.  
• Total broadband connections increased by about ten times, from 610 lakh in 2014 to 5,946 
lakh in June 2019.  
• The number of mobile internet subscribers was 6,436 lakh at the end of June 2019 while 
the number of wireline internet subscribers was 217 lakh.  
India is now the global leader in monthly data consumption, with average consumption per 
subscriber per month increasing 157 times from 62 MB in 2014 to 9.8 GB in June 2019. The cost 
of  data  has  also  reduced  substantially,  enabling  affordable  internet  access  for  millions  of 
citizens. 
With the increasing role of technology in our daily lives and the growing significance of Industry 
4.0, India can only unlock its true potential once digital connectivity, the basic building block for 
most technological solutions, reaches the last mile. 
7.2.1.	Constraints	
• Broadband  connectivity:  Internet  access  is  plagued  by  issues  related  to  quality  and 
reliability, outages, call drops and weak signals. The current definition of broadband of 512 
kbps speed is inadequate and not in line with the expected rise in demand in the future.  
• Digital access and literacy: A significant portion of our population does not have access to 
devices such as laptops, computers, smartphones, etc. Further, Digital literacy in India is 
estimated to be less than 10 per cent of the population. 
• Content  in  Indian  languages: Currently,  most  digital  content  is  in  English.  However,  a 
KPMG11 report suggested that “9 out of every 10 new internet users in India over the next 
5 years are likely to be Indian language users” 
• Availability  of  e-services: A large number of e-services are not available on the digital 
platform and there is wide variation across states in the availability of citizen e-services. 
Currently, citizens have to physically visit government offices to access most government-
to-citizen (G2C) services, as municipalities and other government bodies have been slow to 
digitize their processes.  
• Cyber  security: The regulatory framework for cyber security is inadequate. Hacking and 
denial-of-service attacks have led to disruption of services, both in the government and the 
private sector – banks and governments increasingly face security breaches. 
7.2.2.	Some	developments	
• BharatNet- Government is implementing the flagship BharatNet Programme in a phased 
manner for providing broadband connectivity to all the 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) in 
the country. The project envisages an optimal mix of optical fibre, radio and satellite media 
o As of February 4, 2018, under BharatNet, work had started in 1.24 lakh GPs of which 
1.08 lakh GPs were service ready. 
• Furthermore, the National  Information  Infrastructure (NII) will ensure the integration of 
the  networks  and  cloud  infrastructure  to  provide  high-speed  connectivity  to  various 
government  departments  up  to  the  panchayat  level.  The  components  of  NII  include 
networks such as the State Wide Area Network (SWAN), National Knowledge Network 
(NKN), BharatNet, Government User Network (GUN) and the MeghRaj Cloud. 
• The government also launched the  Public  Internet  Access  Programme to make 2,50,000 
common  service  centres  (CSCs)  operational  at  the  gram  panchayat  level  to  deliver 
government services online.  
o Under  this  programme,  1,50,000  post  offices  will  be  converted  into  multi-service 
centres.

Student Notes: 
o The last mile connectivity, through Wi-Fi or any other suitable broadband technology, is 
to be provided at all GPs in the country, funded by the Universal Service Obligation 
Fund (USOF). 
Universal Service Obligation Fund 
• To give impetus to the rural telephony, Government formed a Universal Service Obligation Fund 
(USOF) by an Act of Parliament (Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Act, 2003). Various schemes have 
been launched by USOF with a view to improve the penetration of telecom facilities in rural and 
remote areas of the country.  
• The  resources  for  implementation  of  USOF  are  raised  through  a  Universal  Service  Levy  (USL) 
which has presently been fixed at 5% of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of all Telecom Service 
Providers except the pure value added service providers like Internet, Voice Mall, E-Mail service 
providers etc.  
• In addition, the Central Govt. may also give grants and loans.  
• The Fund is to be utilized exclusively for meeting the Universal Service Obligation. The latter has 
been defined in the Act as the obligation to provide access to telegraph services to people in rural 
and remote areas at affordable and reasonable prices. 
7.2.2.1. National Broadband Mission 
National Broadband Mission(NBM) was launched on 17th December 2019 with a vision to fast 
track growth of digital communications infrastructure, bridge the digital divide, facilitate digital 
empowerment and inclusion, and provide affordable and universal access of broadband for all. 
Some of the objectives of the Mission which is structured with strong emphasis on the three 
principles of universality, affordability and quality are: 
• Broadband access to all villages by 2022  
• Facilitate universal and equitable access to broadband services for across the country and 
especially in rural and remote areas 
• Laying of incremental 30 lakhs route km of Optical Fibre Cable and increase in tower density 
from 0.42 to 1.0 tower per thousands of population by 2024  
• Significantly improve quality of services for mobile and internet  
• Develop innovative implementation models for Right of Way (RoW) and to work with 
States/ UTs for having consistent policies pertaining to expansion of digital infrastructure 
including for RoW approvals required for laying of OFC  
• Develop  a  Broadband  Readiness  Index  (BRI)  to  measure  the  availability  of  digital 
communications infrastructure and conducive policy ecosystem within a State/UT. 
• Creation of a digital fibre map of the Digital Communications network and infrastructure, 
including Optical Fibre Cables and Towers, across the country  
• Investment from stakeholders of USD 100 billion (Rs 7 Lakh Crore) including Rs 70,000 crore 
from Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)  
• Address policy and regulatory changes required to accelerate the expansion and creation of 
digital infrastructure and services  
• Work with all stakeholders including the concerned Ministries / Departments/ Agencies, 
and Ministry of Finance, for enabling investments for the Mission 
7.2.2.2. Net Neutrality 
Net  neutrality  is  the  principle  that  individuals  should  be  free  to  access  all  content  and 
applications equally, regardless of the source, without Internet service providers discriminating 
against specific online services or websites. 
Without net neutrality rules in place, ISPs can prevent users from visiting some websites, 
provide slower speeds for services like Netflix, or even redirect users from one website to a 
competing website. Net neutrality rules prevent this by requiring ISPs to connect users to all 
lawful content on the internet equally, without giving preferential treatment to certain sites or 
services.

Student Notes: 
In the absence of net neutrality, companies can buy priority access to ISP customers. Larger, 
wealthier companies like Google or Facebook can pay ISPs to provide faster, more reliable 
access to their websites than to potential competitors. This could deter innovative start-up 
services that are unable to purchase priority access from the ISPs. Also, if ISPs can charge online 
services to connect to consumers, consumers would ultimately bear these additional costs 
The telecom regulator TRAI struck down differential pricing for internet services offered by 
telecom players to mobile users, in a bid to uphold the principles of net neutrality—serving a 
big blow to Facebook’s Free Basics and other zero-rated platforms such as Airtel Zero. 
7.2.3.	Way	ahead	
• Broadband  connectivity: As the sector regulator, TRAI should consider putting in place a 
credible system to track call drops, weak signals and outages to ensure the quality and 
reliability of telecom services. The results may be put in the public domain. Government 
should also put in place telecom ombudsman for complaint redressal.  
• Quality  of  service: Adequate  spectrum  availability  is  critical  to  ensure  service  quality. 
Efficient spectrum allocation in large contiguous blocks should be explored. We should also 
explore  migration  to  new  technologies  which  would  resolve  some  of  the  bandwidth 
challenges.  
• Access and digital literacy: Digital literacy needs special focus at the school/college levels. 
The National Digital Literacy Mission should focus on introducing digital literacy at the 
primary school level in all government schools for basic content and in higher classes and 
colleges for advanced content. The multiplier effects of this mission will be realized when 
these  students  in  turn  educate  their  family  members.  Higher  digital  literacy  will  also 
increase the adoption of computer hardware across the country. 
• Content  in  Indian  languages: State governments should pay special attention to creating 
content, particularly those relating to government e-services, in Indian regional languages. 
To  fulfil  the  vision  of  making all government’s online services available in all 22 official 
languages,  there  needs  to  be  focused  collaboration  between  the  centre,  states  and 
researchers to promote Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Indian languages. Focus could 
be laid on the automatic translation of content into regional languages from Hindi or 
English by exploring case studies of the European Union 
• Availability  of  e-services: Individual ministries and states have to play a pivotal role in 
ensuring that all their services are available and easily accessible by citizens over digital 
platforms.  Digital  platforms,  that  enable  real-time  data  updates,  would  increase 
accountability, and facilitate monitoring, quality checks and timely intervention by the 
higher administrative authorities.  
• Cyber  security: MeitY will need to evolve a comprehensive cyber security framework for 
data security, safe digital transactions and complaint redressal. The National e-governance 
Division  of  MeitY  should  periodically  audit  compliance  of  e-services  offered  by  state 
governments. It should bring out a performance report of e-services with a view to improve 
service delivery. 
8.	Logistics	Sector	
This  sector  involves  material  handling,  warehousing,  packaging,  transportation,  shipping 
security, inventory management, and supply chain management, procurement, and customs 
service. 
As per the Economic Survey 2017-18, India’s logistics industry which is worth around USD 160 
billion is likely to touch USD 215 billion in the next two years. 
Finance Ministry had granted infrastructure status to logistic sector by widening the category of 
infrastructure subsectors to "transport and logistics" to ensure Infrastructure lending at easier

Student Notes: 
terms with enhanced limits, access to longer duration funds, tap the external commercial 
borrowing route and refinance existing loans at competitive rates.  
8.1.	Importance	of	Logistic	Sector		
• Employment: Industry employs over 45 million people and is growing at the rate of 15% 
with certain subsectors growing at even 30-40% per annum.  
• GDP: India spends around 14.4% of its GDP on logistics and transportation.  
• Manufacturing Sector: Logistics sector provides efficient and cost effective flow of goods on 
which other commercial sectors depend 
Moreover, an effective multi-modal logistics and transport sector will make our economy more 
competitive due to the following reasons:  
• Reduces  cost: Efficient  transportation  and  logistics  reduce  transport  time  and  costs. 
Moreover, they reduce cost of production by minimizing the need for large inventories. 
This means less capital required for warehouses, insurance and the like.  
• Creates markets for other goods: The conventional view of demand in the logistics sector 
states that it is derived demand. However, growth in transport and logistics enterprises can 
create markets for other goods.  
• Enhances Inter-state trade: Reducing friction via improved logistics could boost inter-state 
trade flows in India that already stand at a healthy 54% of GDP.  
• Keeps  pace  with  demand  for  transport: The  demand  for  transport  has  accelerated 
manifold since the 1990’s. It is important to keep pace with it. Otherwise, it could thwart 
the manufacturing push and attempts to boost farmer earnings to the benefits of urban 
agglomeration economies. 
• Complements  GST: A  robust  multi  modal  logistics  network  will  allow  companies  to 
restructure their supply chains once the domestic market is truly integrated. This would 
complement GST implementation.  
• Lastly, efficient logistics networks can reduce divergence in regional growth. 
8.2.	Constraints	
• Cost of logistics: The cost of logistics remains high due to challenges in accessing finance, 
underdeveloped infrastructure, poor connectivity and an unfavourable modal mix.  
o Logistics costs in India are 13-15 per cent of the product cost, while the global average 
is six per cent. 
• Coordination  due  to  multiple  stakeholders’  involvement: Logistics  has  four  key 
components that account for the majority of the sector: transport, warehousing, freight 
forwarding  and  value  added  logistics.  Each  of  these  falls  under  different  segments  of 
regulatory  oversight,  which  adds  complexity  to  the  system.  The  presence  of  multiple 
agencies often leads to duplicate processes.  
o Further, non-uniform documentation across states adds to transaction costs. While the 
recently  implemented  Goods  and  Services  Tax  (GST)  has  simplified  documentation 
requirements  across  states  to  some  extent,  there  still  remains  further  room  for 
improvement.  
• Warehousing  capacity  and  fragmented  structure: India’s current reported warehousing 
capacity is 108.75 million metric tonnes (MMT) of which the private sector makes up less 
than 20 per cent. There is low value  addition  in  the  warehouse  sector.  Handling  and 
warehousing facilities are still largely un-mechanized with manual loading, unloading and 
handling in the case of many commodities.  
• Seamless  movement  of  goods  across  modes  and  high  dwell  time: In addition to lack of 
interoperable technology, the movement of goods across modes suffers from the absence 
of last mile connectivity and infrastructure. For example, poor road and rail connectivity to 
most non-major ports leads to delays in travel time. The share of cargo moving through

Student Notes: 
coastal shipping is small, primarily due to the lack of infrastructure and connectivity for 
feeder ships that operate between smaller container ports. 
• Competition and underutilized capacity: There is no level playing field as the public sector 
is  provided  benefits  that  are  not  available  to  private  players  such  as  container  train 
operators or foreign vessel owners, leading to limited competition, capacity underutilization 
and other inefficiencies.  
• Interoperable  technology across  modes: The lack of interoperability of software systems 
used by the authorities governing different modes of transport leads to inefficiencies as it 
increases transit time and the need for manual intervention when switching modes.  
• Border compliance and document processing time: India’s average border compliance time 
(including customs regulations and mandatory inspections) for exports is 106 hours and for 
imports 264 hours. India’s document processing time (including documentary compliance 
for various agencies including regulators) is an average of 38 hours for exports and 61 hours 
for imports. 
8.3.	Government	Initiatives	
• Diesel de-regulation: logistics costs have become more accurate, with diesel prices moving 
in tandem with international fuel prices. This forces us to be competitive globally.  
• Logistic enhance efficiency programme: was launched for management and development 
of logistic parks and reduce the cost of logistics.  
• Technology  initiative: Automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) in warehouse and 
transportation,  radio  frequency  identification  (RFID)  in  place  of  bar  codes,  and  global 
positioning system (GPS) for real-time tracking.  
• GST: intended to solve the complex tax structure for logistics which would lead to efficient 
decision making by logistic firms about of logistics - demand, supply, near-to-customer, 
sourcing, transportation costs and inventory costs. 
• The  government  is  working  on  a 'National  Logistics  Policy', which  aims  to  promote 
seamless movement of goods across the country 
8.4.	Way	forward	
• Rationalize  tariffs  and  determine  prices  in  an  efficient  manner  across  different  modes: 
Tariff policies need to be rationalized. The Railways chapter provides details on rail freight 
while the Civil Aviation chapter highlights the need to determine air cargo tariffs in a 
consistent manner across airports.  
• Create an overarching body that maintains a repository of all transport data: Such a body 
or institute will be responsible for acquiring, managing and disseminating data to internal 
stakeholders. The proposed institute can also conduct robust analysis of the data, which it 
should make publicly available. This body can be a part of the logistics portal that is under 
development.  
• Enhance  efficiency  of  warehouses  and  their  operation,  especially  to  optimize  food 
storage: Create vertical silos for food storage and transport food grains by specialized 
wagons. We could operate smaller silos at the mandi level connected to mother silos that 
have bulk handling and rail connectivity.  
o Further, specialized wagons with top loading and bottom discharge functions should be 
made available for handling grains.  
o Existing  warehouses  can  be  converted  into  multistoreyed  ones  to  store  multiple 
commodities at the same time. This will greatly increase warehousing space.  
• Increase emphasis on multimodal solutions: Setting up multimodal logistics parks will help 
address issues related to underdeveloped infrastructure, an unfavourable modal mix and 
connectivity. The government has already approved 24 logistics parks under the Bharatmala 
programme and seven have been identified under the Sagarmala programme. These may

Student Notes: 
be completed by 2022-23. They should reflect best practices from global logistics parks with 
respect to comprehensive development and synergies across modes of transport.  
• Increase  technology  use  to  enhance  logistics: Integrate  technologies  across  modes  of 
transport by developing an integrated information technology (IT) platform. Increasing the 
interoperability of technology across modes by implementing container tracking systems, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), etc., will reduce delays and enhance efficiency. The 
integrated IT platform should be a single window for all logistics related matters.  
• Shift towards international standards for transport equipment and software: To increase 
efficiency and ensure compatibility, we should gradually adopt international standards, 
especially in operations, and adopt global benchmarking on unit load devices such as 
containers and pallets. While this will require changes in the overall infrastructure of ships, 
ports and railways, it will help realize savings in cost, time and accounting.  
o Associated  handling  equipment  such  as  forklifts,  cranes,  tractors,  scanning  and 
inspection  technologies,  and  flatbed  rail  wagons  should  also  be  standardized  and 
become ubiquitous. 
9.	Energy	
Energy is a key driver of economic growth. Sustainable, stable and reasonably priced energy is 
essential for the fruits of economic development to reach the bottom of the pyramid.  
India is the third largest energy consumer in the world after USA and China. However, in 2017, 
its per capita energy consumption was about 625.6 kilogram of oil equivalent (kgoe) against the 
world average of 1860 kgoe. The US and China’s per capita energy consumption in 2015 was 
6800 kgoe and 2170 kgoe, respectively. 
With  a  share of  5.8  per  cent  of  the  world’s  primary  energy  consumption,  India’s  energy 
requirement is fulfilled primarily by Coal, Crude Oil, Renewable Energy and Natural Gas. India’s 
energy mix is dominated by coal with a 49.6 per cent share, followed by oil (28 per cent), 
biomass (11.6 per cent), gas (7.3 per cent), renewable and clean energy (2.2 per cent) and 
nuclear energy (1.2 per cent). 
India is looking at using renewable energy to meet multiple objectives: energy security, energy 
efficiency, de-carbonization, and sustainability, among others. India’s fossil fuel requirements, 
which comprise nearly 90% of primary energy supply, are increasingly being met by imports. 
India is also committed to meeting its commitments stated in the Paris Agreement. Renewable 
energy is an element in achieving these objectives. 
9.1.	Current	Status	
9.1.1.	Oil	and	Gas	
India’s oil production is one of the lowest among the major economies of the world and has 
been declining over a period of time. During 2019-20, the domestic crude oil production is 
estimated to be 32.6 MMT. The reduction in crude oil production may be attributed to natural 
decline in ageing and matured fields and no major discoveries. 
India with a refining capacity of 249.4 MMTPA is the fourth largest in the world after the United 
States, China and Russia.  
• Refinery capacity increased from 234.0 MMT in 2017- 18 to 247.6 MMT in 2018-19 
• However, refinery capacity utilisation fell to 103.9 per cent in 2018-19, compared to 107.7 
per cent in 2017-18 
During 2019-20, the domestic production of natural gas is estimated to be 31.8 billion cubic 
metres (BCM).

Oil and Gas supply chain:  
• Upstream Sector: They identify oil and natural gas deposits and engage in the extraction of 
these resources from underground. Eg: ONGC, Oil India ltd.  
• Midstream  sector:  This  sector  involves  transportation  of  oil  and  gas  from  blocks  to 
refineries and from refineries to distribution centers. It also includes storage infrastructure.  
• Downstream sector: They include refineries and marketing. eg Indian Oil Corporation Ltd – 
It is largest company in India by sales and second largest refiner ( 31% share). 
9.1.2.	Power	
Power sector in India has witnessed a paradigm shift over the years due to the constant efforts 
of  Government  to  foster  investment  in  the  sector.  Along  with  universal  electrification, 
commendable  progress  has  been  made  in  generation  and  transmission  of  electricity.  The 
installed capacity has increased from 3,56,100 MW in March 2019 to 3,64,960 MW as on 
31.10.2019. The break-up fuel-wise and sector-wise is given in the figure below: 
 
Structure of the power sector in India  
Power generation, transmission, and distribution are the three main processes involved in the 
power sector.  
• Power generation: India’s installed capacity for power generation recorded a compounded 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9%, an increase from 124 GW to 344 GW between 2006 
and 2018. India is now the third largest electricity generator in the world. Also, India is at 
106th position in terms of per capita consumption in 2017, according to world energy 
statistics published by the IEA.  
• Transmission: The generated electricity is then transported over hundreds of kilometres to 
load  centers  using  transmission  lines  and  transmission  towers  to  supply  power  to 
consumers. This stage connects electricity producers and end-consumers. Transmission has 
taken rapid strides in India, with a CAGR of 7.2% between fiscals 2012 and 2018, raising 
India’s transmission line capacity to 3.9 lakh ckm (circuit kilometre).  
• Distribution: The third stage which involves the distribution of power to all the consumers 
across the nook and corner of the country is where the DISCOMs come into the picture. 
DISCOMs in UTs are administered directly by the central government while the respective 
state governments govern those in the states. o Private DISCOMs are also operational in 
India but are limited to a few cities such as Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd and Reliance 
Energy Ltd in Mumbai.

9.1.3.	Renewable	energy	
Across the world, many of the developed and developing countries have started giving primacy 
to rapidly increase the percentage of renewable energy in the overall energy mix of their 
economies. Renewable Energy has become one of the most important factors and hope for the 
world to preserve the pristine environment and the planet’s resources for future generations.  
India’s INDC builds on its goal of installing 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power capacity by 
2022 by setting a new target to increase the country’s share of non-fossil-based installed 
electric capacity to 40 percent by 2030. In this, 100 GW would come from solar power installed 
capacity in the country, of which 40 GW is targeted through solar rooftop.  
The INDC also commits to reduce India’s GHG emissions intensity per unit GDP by 33 to 35 
percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion 
tonnes of carbon dioxide through additional tree cover. 
India’s wind energy sector is led by indigenous wind power industry and has shown consistent 
progress. The expansion of the wind industry has resulted in a strong ecosystem, project 
operation capabilities and manufacturing base of about 10,000 MW per annum. The country 
currently has the fourth highest wind installed capacity in the world with total installed capacity 
of 37.50 GW (as on 31st December, 2019) 
 
9.2.	Issues	
9.2.1.	Oil,	Gas	and	Coal	
Oil & gas  
• Non-discriminatory access for private and public sector companies to the gas pipeline 
network does not exist.  
• Lack of market-driven gas prices for old fields disincentivizes further production.  
• The gas pipeline infrastructure is also inadequate.  
Coal  
• Unfavourable  socio-economic  environment  in  East  India- There is a tendency to expand 
opencast  mining  and  discourage  underground  operation  even  for  better  quality  coal 
reserves. The damage from open-cast mining is irreparable, rendering the land useless.  
o Deforestation has become rampant, hampering ecology in these areas.  
o People displacement has also increased due to infertile land and non-availability of 
water. 
• Civil unrest is another important reason for not mining efficiently. Coal reserves are most 
highly concentrated in areas where Maoist guerrillas operate, making the area hostile for 
mining.  
• Increasing  illegal  mining  and  exporting  of  coal is also an issue. Litigation against them 
often goes on for years, so illegal mining hasn’t been controlled yet.  
• Rising  imports- imports of the coal have surged to a record over the same period. The 
reasons include higher landed costs of domestic coal at distant locations (exacerbated by 
high railways transportation costs), better quality of imported coal and lower ash content, 
selected power plant boilers being designed to a particular quality of imported coal, and a 
lack of domestic coking coal production (for the steel sector).  
• Infrastructure- e.g. an overworked railway network has hampered transport of the fuel; 
Land for coal mining is becoming a major issue etc.

Student Notes: 
• Issues with coal india: Coal India produced a record 607 million metric tons but falling short 
by 22% of a target proposed in 2017. Till date, CIL’s 54 coal-mining projects are facing delays 
due to various reasons such as contractual issues and delays in securing green clearances, 
among other factors. 
9.2.2.	Power	
• Old inefficient plants continue to operate whereas more efficient plants are underutilized.  
• Thermal capacity addition is plagued by the growing fuel availability concerns faced by the 
Industry.  
o While a significant gas based capacity of more than 20,000 MW is idle due to non-
availability of gas. Coal supplies by CIL is restricted to around 65% of actual coal 
requirement  by  coal  based  thermal  plants,  leading  to  increased  dependence  on 
imported coal with the cascading result of high power generation costs.  
• Increasing power generation costs due to limited fuel availability, poor financial health of 
State Discoms, high AT&C losses have contributed in suppressed  demand  projections by 
State Discoms.  
o Transmission  and  Distribution  (T&D)  or  Aggregate  Technical  &  Commercial  (AT&C) 
losses are around 20% in 2015-16 with huge disparity in T&D losses across the states 
mainly due to poor grid connectivity. 
• Vague Definitions of Electrification create a false sense of achievement, While all inhabited 
villages out of them have now been electrified, only 1,321 have access to power for all their 
households.  
• Although  legally  independent,  Regulatory  Commissions  are unable  to  fully  regulate 
discoms and fix rational tariffs.  
• Unmetered power supply to agriculture provides no incentive to farmers to use electricity 
efficiently.  
• There is a lot of hidden demand because of unreliable supply and load shedding.  
• State power utilities are not able to invest in system improvements due to their poor 
financial health.  
• High  industrial/commercial  tariff  and  the  cross-subsidy  regime  have  affected  the 
competitiveness of the industrial and commercial sectors. 
9.2.3.	Renewable	energy		
• High energy costs result in reneging on old power purchase agreements (PPAs) and erode 
their  sanctity.  This  leads  to  uncertainty  regarding  power  offtake  and  consequently 
endangers further investments.  
• Flexibility in generation and balance requirements for the integration of renewable energy 
are emerging as major issues. With the increasing role of renewable in energy mix, there is 
a need for expanding grid connectivity infrastructure for last man connectivity. 
• There are supply chain issues in biomass power generation. 
• The hydro power industry has been clamouring for long-tenure financing, with softer loan 
terms, easing of CERC/SERC norms to reflect reduction in tariff in initial years, all of which 
would help in unlocking benefits of hydro power. 
9.2.4.	Energy	efficiency		
• Limited technical capabilities, high initial capital expenditure, limited market and policy 
issues have adversely affected efforts to achieve energy efficiency. 
• High transaction costs (which involves appointing suitable consultants and vendors for 
execution)  relative  to  project  size,  especially  in  MSME  sector,  makes  energy  efficiency 
investments unattractive for investors.

Student Notes: 
• The  non-availability  of  sufficient  credit  facilities  and  difficulties  in  obtaining  required 
finances for energy saving projects are strong deterrents to investments in energy efficiency 
in India. 
Other issues: A variety of subsidies and taxes distort the energy market and promote the use of 
inefficient  over  efficient  fuels.  They  also  make  Indian  exports  and  domestic  production 
uncompetitive as energy taxes are not under GST and hence, no input credit is given. This is a 
serious lacuna. 
9.3.	Key	developments	
9.3.1	Oil,	Coal	and	Gas	
9.3.1.1 Commercial coal mining 
Recently, government has allowed all private entities to enter into commercial mining without 
end use or price restrictions. Since nationalization of the sector in 1970s, Coal India Ltd (CIL) 
and its associates had monopoly over mining and selling of coal. However, due to its inability to 
keep up with the demand and low quality & high prices of coal to the companies reducing their 
competitiveness has led to opening up of the sector recently. 
Expected benefits 
• Increased production and energy security: It will help the country come closer to its vision 
of producing 1.5 billion tonne of coal annually by 2022.  
• Reduced  imports: It has potential to save on import bill by Rs 30,000 crore as currently 
about 22% of domestic demand is being met through imports despite India being the 3rd 
largest coal producing country in the world. Cheap domestic supply will also keep import 
prices in check.  
• Benefit to power sector: Coal accounts for around 70% of the country’s power generation. 
Thus, it would help stressed power plants to attempt a turnaround through better fuel 
management.  
• Improved efficiency: as coal sector would shift from monopoly to competition. This would 
attract investments from private and foreign players and bring best possible technology in 
the sector.  
However, it needs to ensured that the sector does not get dominated by few private players 
now since it is a capital intensive sector. Moreover, it also goes against clean energy targets 
since in recent times there is pressure on cutting back on coal usage. 
9.3.1.2. Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) 
The Union Cabinet approved the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in 
2016. HELP replaced the erstwhile policy regime for exploration and production of oil and 
gas, known as New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), which had been in existence for 18 
years. 
Features of HELP 
• Uniform License: It will enable the contractor to explore conventional as well as 
unconventional oil and gas resources including CBM, shale gas/oil, tight gas and gas 
hydrates under a single license, instead of the present system of issuing separate licenses 
for each kind of hydrocarbons. 
• Open Acreages: It gives the option to a hydrocarbon company to select the exploration 
blocks throughout the year without waiting for the formal bid round from the Government. 
• Revenue Sharing Model:  Present fiscal system of production sharing contract (PSC) is 
replaced by an easy to administer “revenue sharing model”.

produced  from  these  
blocks. This  is  in  tune  
with  Government’s  policy  
of  “Minimum  
Government  – Maximum

9.3.1.3. Pradhan Mantri 
Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)  
It  aims  to  provide  8  crore 
deposit  free  LPG  connections 
to   women   from   BPL 
households by 2020. The LPG 
Connection  is  released  in  the 
name  of  adult  woman  of  the 
BPL  Family,  with  a  financial 
support of RS 1600/- subject to 
the  condition  that  no  LPG 
connection exists in the name 
of  any  family  member  of  the 
household.  Consumers  will 
have  the  option  to  purchase 
gas  stove  and  refills  on  EMI 
(zero interest), recovered through LPG subsidy received by the beneficiary. 
Recently, government has extended the scope of beneficiaries to be covered under Pradhan 
Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). Earlier, beneficiaries under the PMUY included all the BPL 
families who suffer with at least one deprivation under Socio-economic caste census 2011. It 
has been expanded to cover all SC/ST households, beneficiaries of Antyoday Anna Yojana (AAY), 
PMAY (Gramin), forest dwellers, most backward classes (MBC), Tea and Ex-Tea Garden Tribes, 
people residing in Islands or rivers island. Now, the scheme will cover all the poor households of 
the country. Under this, new beneficiaries will be those, among holders of both ration cards and 
Aadhaar, who will identify themselves as poor through selfdeclaration. 
9.3.1.4. Unified gas price system 
Government is planning to cut down the cost of transportation of natural gas by setting a fixed 
tariff for the transportation of natural gas for longer distances to boost gas consumption. 
Currently, tariffs for pipeline usage are divided into zones of 300km, with the tariff increasing 
for zones further away from the point where gas is injected. All of India’s imported natural gas 
arrives at terminals on the west coast leading to costs for buyers increasing, the further east 
they are located. 
Expected benefits of unified gas pricing system  
• Reduced overall cost: Currently, transport cost accounts or as much as 10% of the final cost 
of gas to an industry because of low international prices. Usually, it accounts for around 2-
3% of the price of natural gas. 
• Reduction  in  tariffs: Currently, if a buyer needs multiple pipelines even from the same 
operator, that transport tariff would increase by adding the tariffs under different zones.  
• Single market: It would facilitate in creating a single gas market by attracting investment to

complete the Gas Grid as well as ensuring equitable access to natural gas across the 
country.  
• Gas based economy: It would enable improving the affordability of gas across the country 
and attracting investments into the gas infrastructure. This will help achieve government’s 
aim to increase the share of natural gas in the country’s energy mix to 15% by 2030, from 
6% today.  
• Development of new gas markets: Present system causes wide disparity in pipeline tariffs, 
and thus it hinders the development of new demand centers in far-flung and remote areas. 
9.3.1.5. Indian gas exchange  
India’s first gas exchange — the Indian Gas Exchange (IGX) — was launched recently as wholly 
owned subsidiary of Indian Energy Exchange. It is a digital trading platform that will allow 
buyers and sellers of natural gas to trade both in the spot market and in the forward market for 
imported natural gas across three hubs —Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat, and Kakinada in Andhra 
Pradesh.  
• Imported Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) will be regassified and sold to buyers through the 
exchange, removing the requirement for buyers and sellers to find each other. The bidding 
is  done  in  an  anonymous  manner,  where  the  buyer  and  seller  do  not  know  their 
counterpart.  
• The price of domestically produced natural gas is decided by the government and it will not 
be sold on the gas exchange. Domestic production of gas has been falling over the past two 
fiscals as current sources of natural gas have become less productive.  
o Domestically produced natural gas currently accounts for less than half the country’s 
natural  gas  consumption;  imported  LNG  accounts  for  the  other  half.  Hence,  IGX 
encourages trading in imported LNG. 
9.3.1.6. National gas grid 
The  Cabinet  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  has 
approved  a  Capital  Grant  as  the  Viability  Gap 
Funding to Indradhanush Gas Grid Ltd for setting up 
the North East Natural Gas Pipeline Grid. At present, 
there are about 16800 km long Natural Gas pipeline 
network which is operational in the country. In order 
to make available natural gas across the country, it 
has  been  envisaged  to  develop  additional  about 
14,300 km pipelines to complete the National Gas 
Grid and same are at various stages of development.  
This would ensure easy availability of natural gas 
across  all  regions and  also  potentially  help  to 
achieve uniform economic and social progress. 
It aims to remove regional imbalance within the country with regard to access of natural gas 
and provide clean and green fuel throughout the country; to connect gas sources to major 
demand centres and ensure availability of gas to consumers in various sectors and development 
of City Gas Distribution (CGD) Networks in various cities for supply of CNG and PNG.

Student Notes: 
• Poor  financial  condition  of  power  distribution  companies  (discoms):  The  regulatory 
Commissions while calculating tariffs often deferred the recovery of revenue for the future. 
This resulted in weakening of the financial health of the discoms due to under recovery of 
the prudent cost.  
• Delays  in  adoption  of tariff: The regulatory commissions adopt the tariff that has been 
determined through a transparent process of bidding in accordance with the ‘tariff policy 
issued by the Central Government’. But no time limit has been prescribed for the process.  
o Also, the Act mandates the regulatory Commissions to determine the tariff after receipt 
of  the  subsidies.  Thus,  the  tariff  contains  a  subsidy  component  and  is  not  cost 
reflective. 
• Enforceability of performance of the contracts: The 2003 Act recognized the contracts for 
supply and purchase of electricity but does not specifically deal with the issues related to 
non-performance of the contract.  
o Non-performance of the contract created uncertainty, upset investment decisions and 
adversely affect ease of doing business.  
• Existence of multiple committees for selection of the posts of Chairpersons and members 
of  related  bodies: This requires constitution of a different selection committee for every 
vacancy which causes inordinate delays in appointments. 
• Non  Functional  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commissions  (SERCS): due to vacancies and 
delays in appointments by the states. 
Key Provisions of the Draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020  
• New  contract  dispute  resolution  authority  to  be  formed: An  Electricity  Contract 
Enforcement  Authority  (ECEA)  will  be  established  as  a  sole  authority  having  original 
jurisdiction to adjudicate upon matters regarding contracts related to purchase, sale or 
transmission  of  electricity  between  a  generating  company  and  a  licensee  or  between 
licensees.  
• Single Selection Committee to be established for selection of Chairperson and Members of 
the  APTEL,  ECEA,  the  Central  Commission,  State  Commissions  and  Joint  Commissions. 
Enabling state as well as central power regulators to specify transmission charges under 
open access.  
• Cost  reflective  Tariff  and  Simplification  of  Tariff  Structure: The appropriate commissions 
shall fix tariff for retail sale of electricity without accounting for subsidy. Any subsidy must 
be provided by the respective governments directly to the consumer.  
• Reduction  of  Cross  Subsidy: The Tariff policy will specify a manner to gradually reduce 
cross-subsidies.  Any  surcharge  and  cross  subsidies  charged  by  SERCs  shall  also  be 
progressively reduced in the manner provided in the Tariff Policy.  
• Cross  Border  Trade  of  Electricity: The Central Electricity Regulatory Commissions (CERC) 
has been empowered to oversee and regulate the cross border trade of electricity as per 
the rules and guidelines prescribed by the central government.  
• Proposes a National Renewable Energy Policy (NREP) to be prepared and notified by the 
Central  Government  in  consultation  with  states.  Under  it  a  minimum  percentage  of 
purchase of electricity from renewable and hydro sources of energy will also be prescribed. 
• Renewable  Purchase  Obligations  (RPO)  to  include  Hydro  energy  sources:  The  State 
Commissions are empowered to specify the RPO as per central guidelines.  
• Creation of National Load Dispatch Centre have been specified. 
9.3.2.2. Key developments related to Discoms 
The distribution sector in India continues to be the weakest link in India’s electricity value chain 
due to multiple reasons such as-  
• Indebtedness: According to the Ministry of Power’s (MoP) payment ratification and analysis 
portal (PRAAPTI) power producers' total outstanding dues owed by distribution firms rose 
over 47 per cent year-on-year to Rs 1.33 lakh crore in June 2020.

Student Notes: 
• Financial incompetency: There have been multiple reports of DISCOMs delaying payments 
owed  to  solar  and  wind  energy  developers  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Tamil  Nadu,  Madhya 
Pradesh, and Telangana. This has made attracting investments into the sector extremely 
challenging.  
• Operational inefficiencies due to huge technical and commercial losses (AT&C), which are 
primarily caused by power theft, poor payment collection procedures, and inadequate tariff 
hikes.  
• Increasing open access transactions: A steep fall in prices of power generated by solar and 
wind energy projects are driving their most resourceful commercial and industrial (C&I) 
customers to engage in private power purchase through open access.  
• Lack of political will and transparency in dealing with phasing out of energy subsidies.  
• Decline in demand during lockdown: Agricultural consumers and domestic consumers pay 
a  lower  tariff  which  is  compensated  by  a  higher  tariff  for  commercial  & industrial 
establishments. As a result of lockdown, operations of commercial establishments and 
industries came to a grinding halt, affecting the revenue for DISCOMs.  
• Lack of progress in earlier initiatives: The government, under various regimes, has tried to 
improve the condition of DISCOMs in India through relief packages. For eg- under UDAY 
programme,  state  governments  took  over  75%  of  DISCOMS’  debt,  issuing  low-interest 
bonds to service the rest of the debt. DISCOMs were further supposed to reduce instances 
of operational and financial mismanagement. Although there were some initial signs of 
progress under UDAY, the program has not been able to help minimize DISCOM losses. 
Ujwal	DISCOM	Assurance	Yojana	(UDAY)	
Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), a scheme for financial and operational turnaround of 
Power  Distribution  Companies  was  formulated  and  launched  by  the  Government  on  20
th
 
November, 2015 in consultation with the various stakeholders. The scheme aims to provide a 
permanent solution to legacy debts of approximately Rs.4.3 lakh crores and address potential 
future losses. 
Features: 
• It empowers DISCOMs with the opportunity to break even in the next 2-3 years. This is 
through four initiatives (i) Improving operational efficiencies of DISCOMs; (ii) Reduction of 
cost of power; (iii) Reduction in interest cost of DISCOMs; (iv) Enforcing financial discipline 
on DISCOMs through alignment with State finances. 
• It  involved  a  tripartite  agreement  (Memorandum  of  Understanding,  MoU)  between 
Ministry of Power (MoP), state governments and respective DISCOMs.  
• Under  UDAY,  DISCOMS  can  convert  their  debt  into  state  government  bonds,  but  are 
required to fulfill certain conditions such as AT&C loss reduction, mandatory metering, 
power purchase planning and performance monitoring. In lieu, state governments took 
over three-fourths of discom debts, thus reducing the interest burden.  
• After UDAY had been implemented, aggregate discom debt had fallen from ₹ 2.7 lakh crore 
in September 2015 to ₹ 1.9 lakh crore in FY16 and ₹ 1.5 lakh crore in FY17.  
• A Multi-Level Monitoring mechanism for Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) has been 
put in place to ensure a close monitoring of performance of the participating States under 
UDAY. 
A CRISIL report has analyzed the DISCOMS in 15 states that account for 85% of the aggregate 
losses. As per it, the downward trajectory is now expected to reverse, moving up to ₹ 2.28 lakh 
crore in FY19 and ₹ 2.64 lakh crore in FY20.  
Reasons for reversal 
• Limited  Fiscal  space- it makes continuous financial support to their DISCOMS difficult. In 
2016, most states had the fiscal headroom to assume three-fourths of the debt of their

Student Notes: 
discoms, but now, because of the deterioration in their finances over the past few years, 
the space has become limited.  
• Operational  Inefficiencies- e.g. across several states, there is a lack of effective billing 
procedures,  poor  measurement  of  power  consumption,  and  ineffective  monitoring  of 
power theft. 
• Increased  Power  Purchase  Cost- After the one-time measures under UDAY, the power 
purchase costs have now increased by 5 per cent in the first nine months of 2018-19. 
Further the input costs of coal and freight have gone up.  
•  Lack  of  structural  reforms- such as AT&C losses reduced by only 400 bps by December 
2018 from preUDAY levels, against the target of reducing AT&C losses by 900 basis points to 
about 15% in 2018-19.  
• Lack  of  adequate  tariff  hikes- The average tariff increases were a paltry 3% per annum 
against the target of implementing regular tariff hikes of 5-6% per annum and now with the 
focus on new rural connections, further increases are unlikely. Even if the Discoms have 
improved their operational efficiency, but state regulators in some cases have not allowed 
electricity tariffs to keep pace with input costs. 
Privatising	Discoms	
The government is planning to privatise the electricity distribution companies (discoms) in 
Union Territories (UTs) by January 2021 as it seems to address many of the above discussed 
issues. 
There are sufficient case studies when private players have been proved to run cash strapped 
Discoms successfully via more efficiency, increased revenue and improved consumer services. 
For eg.- The aggregate technical & commercial (AT&C) losses in Delhi after the privatization in 
2002 has been brought down from a high of 53% to around 8%.  
9.3.2.3. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) 
The big push to rural electrification came in 2005 with the launch of the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen 
Vidyutikaran  Yojana  (RGGVY)  and  then  accelerated  further  in  2010-11,  when  there  was  a 
significant increase in budgetary outlay for this. However, the RGGVY programme failed to live 
up to its motives.  
Then the RGGVY was subsumed in the new scheme, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana 
(DDUGJY), as rural electrification (RE) component. The major components of DDUGJY are: 
(i) Separation of agriculture and non-agriculture feeders facilitating judicious rostering of 
supply to agricultural & non- agricultural consumers in the rural areas; 
(ii) Strengthening and augmentation of subtransmission & distribution infrastructure in rural 
area; 
(iii) Metering of distribution transformers/feeders/consumers; 
(iv) Ongoing  rural  electrification  works  of  erstwhile  scheme  subsumed  in  DDUGJY  as  RE 
component 
Some features 
• complete flexibility to state for selecting scope of works as for their priority 
• all villages eligible without any minimum population criteria 
• all discoms including private discoms, RE cooperative societies are eligible 
• district development coordination and monitoring committee namely DISHA headed by 
senior most member of Parliament to review and monitor implementation of scheme 
Significance  
• Socio-Economic  benefit: Providing electricity helps in improving education, health, and 
connectivity apart from having a multiplier effect on increased economic activities and job 
creation.

Student Notes: 
• Gender Empowerment: It mainly affects women and girls more as they have to bear the 
primary responsibility for collecting firewood, cooking and other domestic work  
• Improving Discoms Health: Electricity access to households with meters will create demand 
which in turn will help in improving the financial health of the respective discoms.  
• Better Policy Formulation: It will help in appropriately estimating, planning and budgeting 
for complete household electrification over the next two years.  
• Boost to rural demand: There is a direct correlation between improving electricity access 
and business environment in country. Electrification, therefore, would provide a fillip to 
rural demand.  
• Achieving Climate Commitment: It will lead to decline in black marketing of kerosene oil 
and  meeting  country  global  climate  change  commitments  as  electricity  will  substitute 
kerosene for lighting. 
• Sustainable Development Goal: Access to energy services is critical for advancing human 
development, furthering social inclusion of the poorest & most vulnerable in society and to 
meeting many of the SDGs. 
9.3.2.4. Saubhagya Yojana 
With an aim to provide electricity to over four crore families in rural and urban areas, Pradhan 
Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana ‘Saubhagya’ scheme was launched. Despite the government’s 
aggressive  village  electrification  programme,  under  the  Deen  Dayal  Upadhyay  Gram  Jyoti 
Yojana, it was realised that the problem of electricity ‘access’ wasn’t resolved. With a large 
number of household still remaining without access to electricity, the scheme aims at ensuring 
the coverage of households as opposed to only villages. 
Key features 
• It aims to provide electricity to all families in India.  
• Funding Pattern is 60% by central grants, 30% by bank loans and 10% by states. 
• The government will use Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data to identify the 
beneficiaries for free electricity connections.  
• The  Rural  Electrification  Corporation  Limited  will  be  the  nodal  agency  for  the 
operationalization of the scheme throughout the country.  
• For those household where the national electricity grid can’t reach, households will be 
provided with solar power packs along with battery banks  
• SAUBHAGYA PORTAL would disseminate information on household electrification status 
(state, district, village-wise), and household progress on live basis 
All  the  States  have  reported  electrification  of  all  households  on  Saubhagya  portal,  as  on 
31.03.2019, except few households in LWE affected Bastar region of Chhattisgarh

9.3.3.1. Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) 
Recently, various states have been working to renegotiate the Power Purchase Agreements 
(PPAs) with the renewable energy companies. 
A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is a contract between two parties, one who generates 
electricity and one who is looking to purchase electricity. In India, the state governments have 
entered into such agreements with private renewable energy companies to establish the power 
plant  and  sell  the  power  back  to  the  government.  With  PPAs  in  place,  India  can  boost 
renewable  energy  generation  in  the  country  and  incentivise  the  global  renewable  energy 
companies to invest by giving them. 
In the recent times, some state governments have reviewed/ moved out from their respective 
agreements. There is a concern of mounting debts and untimely payments by the state power

Student Notes: 
distribution companies (DISCOMs. The PPAs are signed for longer durations like 15-25 years and 
the states are feeling the heat of higher tariffs they have agreed in the PPAs.  
Moreover,  dynamic  nature  of  tariffs  is  also  one  of  the  reason  behind  revisiting  the  tariff 
agreements. E.g. Andhra Pradesh’s signed PPAs with various wind power generators around Rs 
4.76  per  unit  in  2015,  which  appeared  competitive  at  that  time.  Now,  the  Solar  Energy 
Corporation of India (SECI) managed to get bids as low as Rs 3.46 per unit. 
However, renegotiation might affect investor sentiments & discourage new investments. Also, 
the banks have lent heavily to these developers, so with shutting down of projects, the loans 
may not be serviced. It could start a new cycle where the banks will be apprehensive in 
advancing loan to such generators. 
9.3.3.2. Bundling Scheme for round-the-clock power supply 
Recently, Ministry of power issued guidelines for supply of RTC power to distributors through a 
Bundling Scheme, which is first of its kind scheme in world. It is a plan to sell renewable energy 
(RE) and thermal power in a bundle so that end users can get uninterrupted supply of power. 
Currently, renewable energy has intermittency issues and hence, to meet large-scale power 
requirements, the government has sought to blend renewables with thermal power. 
Earlier, Government also declared large hydro power (above 25 MW projects) as renewable 
energy sources that were eligible for various incentives like financial assistance and cheaper 
credit. With the government’s decision, hydro projects above 25 MW can also avail the benefits 
of bundling. 
9.3.3.3. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyaan (Pmkusum) 
Scheme 
The scheme consists of 3 components Component-A: Setting up of 10,000 MW of Decentralized 
Grid  Connected  Solar  or  other  Renewable  Energy  Power  Plants  on  barren/fallow  land; 
Component-B: Installation of 17.50 Lakh stand-alone solar agriculture pumps; and Component-
C: Solarisation of 10 Lakh Grid Connected Agriculture Pumps. 
All three components combined, the scheme aims to add a solar capacity of 25,750 MW by 
2022. 
9.3.3.4. National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy 
The Ministry issued National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy in  2018. The main objective of the policy 
is to provide a framework for promotion of large grid connected wind-solar PV hybrid system 
for optimal and efficient utilization of wind and solar resources, transmission infrastructure and 
land. The wind - solar PV hybrid systems will help in reducing the variability in renewable power 
generation  and  achieving  better  grid  stability.  The  policy  also  aims  to  encourage  new 
technologies, methods and wayouts involving combined operation of wind and solar PV plants.  
The major highlights of this policy are as under:  
a. A wind-solar plant will be recognized as hybrid plant if the rated power capacity of one 
resource is at least 25% of the rated power capacity of other resource.  
b. Both AC and DC integration of wind solar hybrid project are allowed.  
c. The power procured from the hybrid project may be used for fulfilment of solar RPO and 
non-solar RPO in the proportion of rated capacity of solar and wind power in the hybrid 
plant respectively.  
d. Existing wind or solar power projects, willing to install solar PV plant or WTGs respectively 
to avail benefit of hybrid project, may be allowed.  
e. All fiscal and financial incentives available to wind and solar power projects will also be 
made available to hybrid projects.

9.3.3.5. Green Energy Corridor 
In order to facilitate integration of large scale renewable generation capacity addition, the 
Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) in FY 2015-16, approved the creation of Intra-
state  Transmission  System  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Himachal  Pradesh, 
Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Rajasthan  and  Tamil  Nadu,  rich  in  renewable 
resource  potential  and  where  large  capacity  renewable  power  projects  are  planned.  The 
creation of the Intra-State Transmission System will facilitate the evacuation of over 20 GW of 
power from renewable energy generation stations to load centres. 
The project is anticipated to be completed by 2021 with funding mechanism consisting of 40% 
Central  Grant,  40%  KfW  loan  (Euro  500  million)  and  the  remaining  20  percent  as  State 
contribution. 
9.3.4.	Energy	Efficiency	
• Unnat  Jyoti  by  Affordable  LED  for  All  (UJALA)  programme: Under UJALA scheme, LED 
bulbs, LED Tube lights and Energy efficient fans are being provide to domestic consumers 
for replacement of conventional and inefficient variant 
o Till date, over 36.46 crore LED bulbs, 72.01 lakh LED Tube lights and 23.34 lakh Energy 
efficient fans distributed by EESL across India. This has resulted in estimated energy 
savings of 47.87 billion kWh per year with avoided peak demand of 9,683 MW, GHG 
emission reduction of 39 million t CO2 per year and estimated annual monetary savings 
of INR 19,100 crore in consumer electricity bills.

smart meters. As on date, EESL has installed over 13.2 lakh smart meters in Uttar 
Pradesh, New Delhi, Haryana and Bihar under this programme. 
9.4.	Way	ahead	
Overall energy  
• Oil, natural gas, electricity and coal may be brought under GST to enable input tax credit.  
• Have the same GST rate for all forms of energy to enable a level playing field.  
• All  form  of  subsidies  should  be  provided as  functional  subsidies  to  end-consumers  to 
empower them to choose the energy form most suitable and economical to them. 
• According to NITI AAYOG, the energy demand in India is likely to go up by 2.7-3.2 times 
between 2012 and 2040. Thus, there is a need to augment generation capacity.  
9.4.1.	Power		
• Promote  smart  grid  and 
smart meters.  
• All  PPAs  including  those 
with   state   generation 
companies (gencos) should 
be  based  on  competitive 
bidding.  
• Introduce   a   capacity 
market   to   encourage 
flexible  capacity  for  peak 
demand and intermittency. 
• Privatizing state 
distribution utilities and/or 
the  use  of  a  franchisee 
model  will  reduce  AT&C 
losses.  
• Discoms  may  adopt  a 
franchisee  model  for  its 
retail  business  in  rural 
areas  and  stipulate  a 
minimum   level   of 
performance  parameters, 
including  the  use  of  decentralized  generation  sources  and  storage  systems  for  local 
reliability and resilience.  
• Regulatory bodies need to be further strengthened and made truly independent.  
• For agriculture, an upfront subsidy per acre of land through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) 
may be considered instead of providing separate subsidies for fertilizers, electricity, crop 
insurance etc.  
• Promote the use of solar pumps for agriculture. Local discoms should buy surplus power 
from the farmer.  
• Discoms may be fined for load shedding.  
About Smart Grid 
• Smart  Grid  envisages  providing  choices  to  each  and  every 
customer  for  deciding  the  timing  and  amount  of  power 
consumption  based  upon  the  price  of  the  power  at  a 
particular moment of time 
• Apart  from  providing  choices  to  the  consumer  and 
motivating them to participate in the operations of the grid, 
causing energy efficiency and accommodating all generation 
and  storage  options,  Smart  Grid  also  envisages  various 
properties  for  the  Grid  like  self-healing  and  adaptive 
islanding. This all will enable electricity markets to flourish. 
• Smart  grids  are  sophisticated,  digitally  enhanced  power 
systems  where  the  use  of  modern  communications  and 
control  technologies  allows  much  greater  robustness, 
efficiency and flexibility than today’s power systems. 
• Power  utilities  around  the  world  are  adopting  smart  grid 
technologies to make the power infrastructure robust, self-
healing, adaptive, interactive and cost effective 
• It will save around 15-20% of electricity in the country 
• By reducing the peak demand, a Smart Grid can reduce the 
need for additional transmission lines. 
• Lower  operating  and  maintenance  costs  thereby  meaning 
lower peak demand 
• Would result in reduction in carbon emissions.

assets.  
• Introduce time-of-day tariff to promote the use of renewable energy.  
• Introduce performance-based incentives in the tariff structure.  
• To manage the demand for power, it is necessary to introduce 100 per cent metering, net 
metering, smart meters, and metering of electricity supplied to agriculture.  
9.4.2.	Oil	&	gas		
• Provide for a common carrier and open access to gas pipelines.  
• Separate the developmental and regulatory functions of the PNGRB.  
• Expedite establishing the National Gas Grid.  
• Promote city gas distribution to provide piped natural gas (PNG).  
• Review and provide the required flexibility in contract terms to make stranded oil and gas 
assets functional.  
• Enhance production from the existing fields of ONGC and OIL using cutting-edge technology 
through a framework of production enhancement contracts.  
• Consider market pricing for blocks that are not viable because of low gas pricing.  
• Provide for shared infrastructure for evacuation of oil and gas from small and scattered 
onshore and offshore fields.  
• Provide “priority sector” status for 2G bioethanol projects. The concept of ‘solar parks’ can 
be applied to bio-fuels; land can be leased by the government to oil marketing companies 
(OMCs) for energy crops.  
• The government should provide viability gap funding/financial assistance for 2G ethanol 
project developers/technology partners.  
• Declare regasified liquefied natural gas (R-LNG) as transportation fuel and promote PNG in 
rural areas.  
• Create strategic reserves through various policy options.  
9.4.3.	Coal		
• Expeditiously complete detailed exploration through exploration-cum-mining leases based 
on production/revenue sharing model.  
• Put  the  onus  on  concerned  state  governments  to  make  the  land  required  for  mining 
available. 
• The government should employ more Coal-Handing and Preparation Plants (CHPP) that 
wash coal before shipping. This process removes ash and debris, thereby increasing the 
energy content per tonne by 10-20%. Also, steps need to be taken to adopt clean-coal 
technologies including coal gasification. 
9.4.4.	Renewable	energy		
• Provide a mechanism for cost-effective power grid balancing (gas-based, hydro or storage).  
• Renewable purchase obligations (RPO) should be strictly enforced and inter-state sale of 
renewable energy should be facilitated.  
• It is necessary to have national level markets and regulations for balancing of power. 
Central  level  agencies  like  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  or  National  Load 
Despatch Centre should socialize the costs of balancing interstate transmission systems 
(ISTS)  connected  power  plants,  over  the  entire  system,  on  the  lines  of  the  point  of 
connection (PoC) or a similar mechanism.  
• Decentralized renewable energy in rural areas in conjunction with the discoms’ grid can 
offer reliability.  
• Hybrid renewable energy systems such as solar PV + biomass should be explored.

• Commercial biogas needs to be promoted by providing subsidy to consumers.  
9.4.5.	Energy	efficiency		
• The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) should come out with a white paper on its 5-year 
strategy on energy efficiency in various sectors and specify energy consumption norms.  
• State designated agencies (SDAs) need to be more empowered and provided with adequate 
resources  to  implement  EE  related  programmes.  There  is  a  need  to  ensure  greater 
participation of energy service companies (ESCOs) using appropriate financing models with 
a risk sharing mechanism, particularly by public sector banks.  
• States should adopt the second version of the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) in 
their building by-laws and ensure faster implementation.  
• Promote the mandatory use of LED and the replacement of old appliances in government 
buildings with five-star appliances. Focus the UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All) 
programme  on  lower-income  households  and  small  commercial  establishments.  The 
number of appliances covered under the Standards and Labelling (S&L) programme should 
be increased.  
• Widen and deepen the perform, achieve and trade (PAT) programme; make Energy Saving 
Certificate (ESCert) trading under the PAT scheme effective by ensuring strict penalties 
against defaulters.  
• For the MSME sector, BEE should develop cluster-specific programmes for energy intensive 
industries to introduce energy efficient technologies.  
• The  Forum  of  Regulators  and  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commissions  (SERCs)  should 
provide for lower heat rate requirements for new power stations. Old and inefficient plants 
consuming more than the threshold energy should be retired in a phased manner.  
• Promote the use of the public transport system. Public transport systems may be converted 
to electric in a time bound manner. Expand the corporate average fuel efficiency standards 
(CAFE) beyond passenger cars to other vehicle segme 
Oil 
• a need to augment refining capacity to meet growing demand for petroleum fuels and 
petrochemicals. 
Coal 
Coal companies should take possession of the entire area of land required for the life of the 
project at one instance to avoid delays in land acquisition.  
• Special  task  force  to  grant  necessary  clearances  such  as  mining  lease,  forest  and 
environment clearances, and land acquisition. The number of levels and stages in the 
processes should be reduced.  
• Opening up the sector for more private participation, especially with regard to captive 
mining. Setting up a regulatory authority, which would have powers to comprehensively 
handle coal resource development and regulation of its extraction and use. 
Steps taken by India in improving energy access

• UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All) Yojana: Under it subsidised LED bulbs were 
distributed to public. It is implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) 
• Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana - Scheme for Providing Free LPG connections to Women 
from BPL Households.  
• National Biogas and Manure Management Programme (NBMMP) for setting up of family 
type biogas plants in rural and semi-urban areas of the country.  
• National Biomass Cookstoves Initiative (NBCI) launched by Government of India aims to 
enhance the use of improved biomass cookstoves.  
• Integrated Power Distribution Scheme: It was launched in 2014 to revamp urban power 
supply through strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution networks 
A number of initiatives have been taken up by the Government to ensure promotion of energy 
efficiency in the country like Standards & Labelling programme for appliances by the Bureau of 
Energy Efficiency (BEE), Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme, Energy Conservation Building 
Codes  (ECBC),  Unnat  Jyoti  by  Affordable  LEDs  for  All  (UJALA)  &  Street  Lighting  National 
Programme (SLNP), Promotion of Energy Efficient Fans and Agriculture pump sets, among 
others. 
10.	Infrastructure	and	North	East	Region	(NER)	
The region has immense unexploited potential for development. The region is the natural 
gateway (with 98% international borderlines) for India to the East Asian, South East Asian and 
South Asian economies. 
• The region is rich in natural resources like water, petroleum and natural gas. 52% of the NER 
is covered with forests and is endowed with exotic flora, fauna and a rich mineral resource 
base. 
• The region has a huge potential for generation of hydropower, solar power and wind 
energy.  
However it is grappling with following issues in infrastructure and energy sector that needs to 
be addressed to help realize the potential of the region: 
• Lack of connectivity and infrastructure has also led to low trade activity in the region. 95% 
of India's exports to neighboring states of Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar are from 
regions other than North East India.  
• The region lacks in energy self-sufficiency. The main factors contributing to this are low 
capacity utilization of power generation units, weak connectivity with the eastern grid and 
a limited carrying and distribution capacity. 
Way forward for NER with respect to infrastructure development 
• Ironing out the transit treaties and the development of physical infrastructure between the 
NER and neighboring countries. We must forge digital connectivity, distribution of power 
and transport links with the latter.  
• On-going  transport  connectivity  projects  including  the  East  West  Corridor,  Special 
Accelerated Road Development Project (SARDP-NE) and Trans Arunachal Highway should be 
closely monitored. The following measures should be taken to stimulate the progress. 
o Enabling expedited approvals. 
o Setting up dedicated Project Implementation Units (PIUs)  
• The government should ensure that key regional connectivity projects are either cleared for 
execution or are tweaked to accommodate the concerns of the related parties. These 
projects include:  
o Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project  
o India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway  
o Bangladesh China India Myanmar Corridor

• Up gradation of Guwahati to an inter-regional aviation hub will be an important milestone 
for the region, which should be expedited.  
• North Eastern states, should be encouraged to liberalise as many tree species as possible 
from the felling and transit rules to generate employment  
• Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and Private Projects should be used as a near term tools 
to boost power generation capacities.  
• In addition, a Shale Oil and Gas Authority can be set-up to exploit the shale oil and gas 
reserves in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

1. Rational energy prices provide the right signal to both producers and consumers and 
also lead to a demand-supply match. Highlight the steps taken by the government for 
rationalizing the energy prices in different sectors. 
Approach: 
Answer should deal with the importance of rational energy prices. Besides, the pricing 
formula or mechanism of various sectors viz. coal, petroleum, gas industry should be 
dealt in the answer. Besides, problems in current formula should be also highlighted. 
Answer: 
Rational energy Prices play significant economic role. It provides the right signals to 
both the producers and consumers and lead to a demand-supply match, providing 
incentives for reducing consumption on the one hand and stimulating production on 
the other. Aligning domestic energy prices with the global prices, especially when large 
imports are involved, may be ideal option as misalignment could pose both micro- and 
macroeconomic  problems.  At  microeconomic  level,  underpricing  of  energy  to  the 
consumer not only reduces the incentive for being energy efficient, it also creates fiscal 
imbalances.  Leakages  and  inappropriate  use  may  be  the  other  implications. 
Underpricing to the producer reduces both his incentive and ability to invest in the 
sector and increases reliance on imports. 
Over the years, India's energy prices have become misaligned and are now much lower 
than global prices for many products. The extent of misalignment is substantial, leading 
to large untargeted subsidies. 
The  government  has  taken  several  initiatives  for  rationalizing  the  energy  prices  in 
different sectors. The Integrated Energy Policy has outlined the broad contours of the 
pricing system for coal. The pricing of coal is done now on gross calorific value (GCV)

Student Notes: 
basis with effect from 31 January 2012, replacing the earlier system of pricing on the 
basis of useful heat value (UHV) which takes into account the heat trapped in ash 
content also, besides the heat value of carbon content. The revision in the GCV is likely 
to  increase  the  prices  of  domestic  coal  to  some  extent,  but  this  is  a  desirable 
adjustment because domestic thermal coal, adjusted for quality differences, continues 
to be underpriced. 
In case of petroleum products pricing, the government dismantled the Administered 
Pricing Mechanism in 2002. This decision, however, was not fully implemented and 
domestic  pass  through  of  global  price  increases  remained  low  for  petrol,  diesel, 
kerosene, and LPG. On 25 June 2010, the government announced that the price of 
petrol was fully deregulated and the oil companies were free to fix it periodically. 
However, diesel price deregulation was deferred. In January 2013, the government 
announced the new roadmap providing for a gradual price increase for reducing diesel 
under-recoveries. Admissibility of subsidized number of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 
cylinders and prices of LPG have also recently been revised. 
Pricing of gas is presently done under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP). The 
government provides the operator freedom to sell the gas produced from the NELP 
blocks at a market-determined price, subject to the approval of pricing formula. The 
government is reviewing pricing under the price sharing contract (PSC) to clarify the 
extent to which producers will have the freedom to market the gas. 
 
2. Differentiate  between  production  sharing  and  production  linked  revenue  sharing 
regimes in the context of oil exploration. Also discuss their suitability w.r.t. promoting 
exploration activity in India. 
Approach: 
Discuss about NELP in brief. Straight forward tabulate the difference. Write the views of 
different stakeholders. Express your own views. 
Answer: 
Production sharing:  
1. Basis of revenue: Companies recover all the cost of capital expenditure and then 
share the profit with government on a percentage basis. 
2. Government  share: Government's  share  depends  upon  the  investment  of  the 
private company and varies inversely with it. 
3. Surprise geological find: Government's share does not increases heavily in case of a 
surprise geological find since investment needs to be recovered first. 
4. Price  surge: In case of price surge, private companies earn more if they are still 
recovering cost but both the company and the government will earn more if cost 
recovered. 
5. Risk: It is attractive for companies since it is less risky. 
6. Cost recovery limit: A maximum limit of cost recovery is set and if company invest 
more than this limit accidently then conflict arises. 
Production linked revenue sharing: 
1. Basis of revenue: Companies are required to state upfront the quantum of oil or 
gas they will share with the government from the very first day of production. 
2. Government  share: Government's share depend upon the level of output of the 
field. 
3. Surprise geological find: Government's share increases in proportion in case of a 
surprise geological find since investment need not to be recovered first.

4. Price surge: In case of price surge, both the company and govt get proportionate 
increment in profit. 
5. Risk: It is not attractive for companies since it is risky as no output at some site may 
cause operational loss. 
6. Cost recovery limit: No such limit exists in this regime. 
Various committees and departments have stated different preferences with relevant 
arguments.  Rangarajan  committee  appointed  by  GOI  suggested  Production  linked 
revenue sharing regime since it is free from complexities related to revenue sharing. 
CAG has also supported this regime. Since auditing at every step can be done and 
company have to cooperate this. 
However private companies prefer production sharing regime. Vijay Kelkar committee 
also suggested this regime for deep sea exploration so as to attract the investors 
because of greater uncertainity. 
 
3. What are the special features of the infrastructure sector that make its financing a 
challenge? What measures have been taken to facilitate adequate amount of finance 
to this sector? 
Approach: 
• Give  a  brief  overview  of  the  current  status  and  the  need  for enhancing 
infrastructure financing in the near future. 
• Delineate  few  economic  characteristics  which  signify  the  distinct  nature  of 
infrastructure assets from other asset classes. 
• Mention some of the important measures undertaken by RBI to improve flow of 
funds. 
• Suggest  some  meaningful  reforms  for  ironing  out  the  current  issues  in  the 
infrastructure sector.  
Answer: 
Infrastructure plays a crucial role in economic development by acting as a catalyst for 
accelerating growth. However, India ranks a dismal 66 amongst 137 countries on Global 
Competitiveness Index for infrastructure, 2017 conducted by World Economic Forum. 
As  per  industry  estimates,  the  investment  into  networked  economic  infrastructure 
would need to double up to $ 6 Trillion in the period 2016-2030 vis-a-vis last 15 years to 
meet the growing demands of the Indian economy; however, infrastructure financing is 
a challenge because of the following factors:  
• Complex  arrangements: Infrastructure projects are often complex and involve a 
large number of parties which lead to diffused accountability.  
• Legal hurdles: Such projects require multiple legal arrangements to ensure proper 
distribution of payoffs and risk-sharing to align the incentives of all parties involved. 
• High gestation period: Long term nature of the projects subjects them to various 
risks including those due to changes in policies, delays in clearances, etc.  
• Asset-liability  mismatch: Due to perceived assurance of government backing for 
maintaining regular financial flows, debt financing is dominated by Public sector 
banks in India who are already facing severe financial crunch due to mounting Non-
Performing Assets (NPAs). 
• Public-private Partnership (PPP): PPP models like BOT haven’t been successful and 
hence not desirable by private sector.

Student Notes: 
• Policy  and  regulation: Uncertain  policies  related  to  applicability  of  Minimum 
Alternate Tax (MAT), introduction of GAAR, land acquisition etc. have increased the 
perceived risk in the infrastructure sector. 
• Cross-cutting  issues: Inefficient transport and energy infrastructure leads to cost 
and time overruns that in turn have a bearing on the techno-economic viability of 
the projects. 
Steps taken to improve flow of funds to infrastructure sector 
• Limited cost overrun financing and extension of time for completion of projects has 
been allowed subject to certain conditions without change in classification of the 
loan. 
• Banks can raise funds from the market by way of infrastructure bonds and the 
assets financed by such funds are exempted from the Priority Sector Lending (PSL) 
requirements. 
• RBI has allowed setting up of Infrastructure Debt Funds (IDFs), both as NBFCs and 
Mutual Funds, to take over the post construction assets from banks. 
• Efficient bond markets for de-risking the banks’ balance sheets for providing credit 
enhancement for bond issuances. 
To  solve  the  problem  of  infrastructure  financing  various  steps  such  as  encouraging 
alternate  sources  of  infrastructure  financing  such  as  Masala  Bonds,  Infrastructure 
Investment Trusts (InvIT), Infrastructure Development Funds (IDF), sovereign funds, 
flexibility for accessing External Commercial Bonds (ECB) etc are required. Deepak 
Parekh  Committee  recommended  mobilizing  infrastructure  financing  by  tapping 
additional avenue from international markets and enriching the financing in terms of 
better  risk  recognition,  longer  tenure  and  lower  cost  of  debt.  Similarly, 
recommendations of Kelkar Committee for fast forwarding the PPP model by focusing 
on service delivery, capacity building and fair allocation of risks and returns is required.  
 
4. Nuclear power has a great potential in India to supplement and in the longer term 
even substitute coal based power as base load. Discuss. Also, mention the steps taken 
by the Government of India in order to achieve nuclear energy self-sufficiency. 
Approach: 
• Explain, in brief, the concept of base load. 
• Mention the potential of nuclear power vis-a vis renewable resources & fossils and 
how it can supplement and substitute coal as base load. 
• Briefly mention a few areas of concern. 
• Steps taken to achieve nuclear self-sufficiency. 
Answer: 
Base load is the minimum amount of power that a distribution company must make 
available to its customers to meet their minimum reasonable demands. Base load may 
vary  at  different  points  of time. An economy cannot operate effectively and grow 
without a stable source of power. In this context, potential of nuclear energy as a base 
load has emerged as a pertinent point of discussion. 
Potential of Nuclear Power to supplement coal:  
• Depleting fossil fuels: More than 70% of petroleum products, 40% of gas and 20% 
of coal consumption are based on imports. India’s known extractable coal reserves 
will run out in about 40 years if our coal consumption keeps growing as it has over 
the past 25 years.

Student Notes: 
• Climate change & environmental pollution are likely to constrain the development 
of coal-based plants. Installation of electrostatic precipitators and carbon capture 
technologies to reduce local air pollution will increase the cost of coal power.  
Nuclear vis a vis other sources which can replace coal: 
• Disadvantage of using renewable energy: Sun and wind may not be available at all 
times. Thus, to achieve base load, it needs to be balanced using other reliable 
sources of energy such as coal, hydro, nuclear, gas etc. 
• Limitation of Hydropower: It is estimated that by 2050, even when we have fully 
developed our hydro potential, we will still need balancing power.  
• Limitation of gas based power is that it has to be imported and India can’t achieve 
self-sufficiency.  Although  India  imports  uranium  but  in  future,  thorium  based 
reactors will make India self-reliant.  
• Indigenous  expertise  is  available  to  operate  Pressurized  Heavy  Water  Reactors 
(PHWRs) built in India.  
However, there certain areas of concerns such as safety of operations including disposal 
of nuclear waste, fixing nuclear liability in case of disaster, high cost of operations, time 
and cost overruns during commissioning of plant, public protests etc. which should be 
addressed by government for wider acceptability of nuclear energy in India. 
Overall, nuclear power is an economically attractive proposition and can bring energy 
self-sufficiency but it has to be materialized without delays and within budget. At 
present, the total installed capacity of Indian nuclear reactors is 6,780 MW—a little 
over 2% of power generated from all sources in the country. The nuclear power holds 
enormous potential for energy security and government has also taken following steps 
to ensure the same: 
• The  Government  has approved  construction  of  10  units  of  India’s  indigenous 
Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) with total capacity of 7000 MW. The 
project will help transform domestic nuclear industry. 
• Civil nuclear agreements with USA, Australia, Japan etc. for technology transfer and 
enriched fuel availability. 
• Adoption of a three stage nuclear power programme in order to utilize thorium 
which is abundantly available in India. 
• Setting up India Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP) with a capacity of Rs.1500 crore to 
provide insurance cover as prescribed under Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage 
(CLND) Act 2010.  
• Amendment of Atomic Energy Act, 1962 to enable Nuclear Power Corporation of 
India (NPCIL) to form joint venture companies with other Indian PSUs. 
 
5. A  number  of  far-reaching  developments  have  taken  place  in  the  local  and  global 
energy space which have to be reflected in our own energy policy framework. Discuss. 
Approach: 
• Give a brief introduction about the major areas around which far reaching changes 
in the local and global energy space are being witnessed. 
• Focus on the impact of these changes and corresponding response required to 
leverage them for increased efficiency and sustainable development in India.  
Answer: 
The changes in energy sector are largely around energy consumption pattern, demand 
& supply and climate change concerns, which call for policy clarity. These are:

Student Notes: 
• Changes in the energy mix: The world is moving away from fossil fuels and even 
within the fossil fuels, away from coal and oil in favour of gas. The share of fossil 
fuels globally in the primary energy mix fell from 88% to 86%, while that of natural 
gas has increased from 23% to 24% between 2005 & 2015. India has set the target 
of producing 175 GW of energy from renewable resources by 2022 and increasing 
the share of non-fossil fuel to 40% by 2030. 
• Abundance in supply of natural gas: The production of natural gas in the world has 
increased to about 1.5 times between 2005 and 2015. It is largely on account of the 
success of horizontal drilling combined with the technology of hydraulic fracture. 
This trend is likely to continue in the foreseeable future, as the price of gas is lower 
than that of oil, and is also one-third lesser as carbon emitting than oil. India has 
adopted  reforms  in  its  natural  gas  policy  under  Hydrocarbon  Exploration  and 
Licensing  Policy,  where  focus  is  given  to  develop  the  capacity  natural  gas 
production. 
• Over supplied oil and gas markets: The prices of oil and gas have fallen by 50% & 
70% respectively and this is triggering energy policy reforms across the world. India 
has reformed its petroleum subsidy regime by deregulating the prices of diesel, 
rationalizing  the excise  duty  on  petroleum  products  to  discourage  their 
irresponsible usage and improving finances. 
• Maturity of renewable energy technologies: The prices of wind and solar energy 
have  witnessed  a  sharp  decline. Tropical  countries,  including  India,  are  richly 
endowed with these resources, and can harness them in an innovative manner to 
meet  energy  requirements  at  decentralised  locations.  India  is  fourth  largest 
producer of Wind energy in the world and is planning to generate 100 GW of solar 
energy - to achieve this target India has conceptualized the International Solar 
Alliance. 
• Nuclear energy: In the Indian context, it’s importance is increasing as a base load 
power to replace unclean coal based thermal power. The Indian government is 
investing  in  indigenous nuclear  reactors  as  well  as  collaborating  with  other 
countries to augment nuclear power in the total energy mix. 
• Climate change concerns: The effects of climate change are more visible today. The 
need to fix poor air quality standards in Indian cities is being felt strongly than ever 
before.  
India has taken some measures to combat the adverse impacts of climate change like 
monitoring of air quality standards and follow-up measures, etc. 
As per India Energy Security Scenarios (IESS), 2047, the energy demand of India is likely 
to go up by 2.7-3.2 times between 2012 and 2040. As such, all the above developments 
offer both a challenge to the existing energy pathways, and an opportunity to respond 
by building in sustainability in the new energy infrastructure.  
India  has  an  opportunity  to  incorporate  emerging  technologies  in  the  new 
infrastructure, to be able to exploit these technologies as they mature and costs falls. 
Having a pro-active policy is necessary to support the trends which bring in efficiency. 
 
6. Special  Purpose  Vehicles  (SPVs)  are  fast  becoming  an  important  avenue  for 
channelising  funds  for  projects  in  infrastructure  sector.  Explaining  the  concept  of 
SPVs,  highlight  some  of  the  benefits  and  risks  associated  with  them.  Also,  suggest 
measures to manage the risks identified.

Student Notes: 
Answer: 
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a legal entity which is formed for a single, well-defined 
lawful purpose. It is a hybrid of a government-controlled body along with the efficiency 
of  the  private  sector.  Technically,  an  SPV  is  limited  company  which  is  setup  in 
accordance to the provisions under Companies Act, 2013. It’s ownership can be public, 
private or joint. There is generally a sponsoring company of the SPV which provides 
initial capital and assets and helps the SPV in raising funds. SPVs are mostly formed for 
raising and lending funds, especially debt funds of longer maturity, directly to eligible 
projects to supplement loans from banks and financial institutions. For instance, SPV 
has been named as National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited to implement the 
project of Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Bullet Train.  
Benefits 
•
 
Professional  management- SPV  will  plan,  appraise,  approve,  release  funds, 
implement,  manage,  operate,  monitor  and  evaluate  the  development  projects. 
Example: The creation of SPVs for each smart city  
•
 
Minimal red tape- For instance, Invest India’s remit is not to make money for the 
shareholders, but to facilitate investments into India, hand-hold investors through 
the bureaucratic maze. 
•
 
Increased  financial  resilience- It helps in separating the risk and freeing up the 
capital. As a result, the SPV and the sponsoring company are protected against risks 
like insolvency, which may arise during the course of operation.  
•
 
Greater operational independence- Infrastructure projects are streamlined as they 
derive benefit from inter-linkages of academic institutions and organizations.  
•
 
Securitization  of  assets - SPVs  allows  securitization  without  disturbing  the 
managerial relationship. Under the arrangement, any predictable income stream 
generated by secure assets can be securitized. 
Risks associated 
•
 
Poor risk management and a misunderstanding of the risks of SPV usage has been a 
factor in a number of high profile failures. There are reputational risks for the 
financing  firm  as  well  as  risks  for  the  investors  in  an  SPV  because  of  lack  of 
transparency. 
•
 
Further, poor performance of SPV can affect the sponsoring firm’s access to capital 
markets. For example, if the SPV to implement a highways project fails, it may 
inhibit the capacity of the private partner as well as the government to raise funds 
from market. 
•
 
Generating  dedicated  and  substantial  revenue  stream  so  as  to  make  it  self- 
sustainable remains a pertaining question. 
Overlapping jurisdictional mandates with the existing companies and institutions.  
Management of risks 
•
 
There should be regular  oversight  and  monitoring of the use of SPV activity in 
order to identify developments that could lead to systematic weakness. 
•
 
Tightening reporting requirements and consolidation of account requirements for 
the use of SPVs. 
•
 
Governance  structures of SPVs should be simplified by putting an end to layers 
upon layers of multi-tiered securitization. 
•
 
Through adequate awareness generation, market participants should be able to 
assess and risk manage factors that increase transaction capability.

7. Discussing the opportunities presented by decentralised energy systems, enumerate 
their environmental, economic and social benefits along with institutional, technical 
and financial challenges that they present. 
Approach: 
•
 
Briefly  explain  the  concept  of  decentralised  energy  systems  and  opportunities 
offered by them. 
•
 
Elaborate on the environmental, economic & social benefits related to them and 
mention the institutional, technical & financial challenges. 
Answer: 
A decentralized energy system is characterised by the location of energy production 
facilities  closer  to  the  site  of  energy  consumption.  It  refers  to  the  wide  range  of 
technologies that do not rely on the high-voltage electricity transmission network or 
the gas grid. This may include: 
•
 Small-scale plants that supply electricity to a building, industrial site or community. 
•
 ‘Microgeneration’ from non-gas heat sources, i.e. small installations of solar panels, 
wind turbines or biomass/waste burners. 
•
 ‘Micro-combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants that effectively replace domestic 
boilers, generating both electricity and heat for the home etc. 
Opportunities 
•
 
It can be used as a supplementary measure to the existing centralized energy 
system.  
•
 
It can be used for deploying renewable energy sources locally available as well as 
expanding access to clean energy services to remote communities.  
•
 
It can aid distributed generation for rural electrification – either through off-grid or 
mini-grid systems.  
Benefits 
•
 
Environmental 
o
 
Optimal use of renewable energy 
o
 
Promotion of carbon neutral and low carbon fuels 
•
 
Economic 
o
 
Increased conversion efficiency (capture and use of heat generated, reduced 
transmission losses) increases eco-efficiency. 
o
 
Increased competition leading to reduction in prices as seen in solar energy. 
o
 
Off-grid distributed generation can reduce the need for expensive transmission 
and distribution network expansion. 
o
 
Creation of new jobs in energy sector 
•
 
Social 
o
 
It provides more flexibility for generation to match local demand patterns for 
electricity and heat. 
o
 
Greater awareness of energy issues through community-based energy systems, 
driving a change in social attitudes and more efficient use of energy resources. 
o
 
Security of supply is increased nationally as customers don’t have to share a 
supply or rely on relatively few, large and remote power stations. 
o
 
Providing energy to off-grid locations promotes inclusive development. 
Challenges 
•
 
Institutional 
o
 
Since decentralised energy systems encourage myriad actors to become power 
producers, it may hamper the state-controlled electricity markets.

o
 
Instituting ownership schemes and pricing systems for off-grid and mini-grid 
services remains a challenge. 
•
 
Technical 
o
 
Large-scale deployment in distributed generation may result in the instability of 
the voltage profile.  
o
 
Emerging  technologies,  such  as  smart  grid,  renewable  energy  and  energy 
storage, will require the operation criteria of the whole power system to be 
redesigned and modified. 
o
 
Lack of experienced workforce in installing, managing and synchronizing these 
systems with main grid. 
•
 
Financial 
o
 
Distributed generation sources often have higher capital cost per kW, compared 
to large central plants. 
Given  that  around  300  million  people  in  India  still  lack  electricity,  decentralised-
generation technologies can play an important role in ensuring uninterrupted energy 
supply. Recognizing this fact, draft policy on Renewable Energy-based Microgrids has 
been formulated, which aims to establish at least 10,000 renewable-based micro- and 
mini-grid projects across the country.  
 
8. If the economic as well as social costs of energy production are accounted for, clean 
coal  offers  itself  as  a  better alternative than renewable sources in terms of carbon 
emission  reduction.  Discuss  the  statement  in  context  of  India's  growing  energy 
demands. 
Approach: 
• Briefly mention the energy demands of India and its sources. 
• Explain clean coal technologies with a few examples. 
• Citing a few advantages of renewable energy, discuss the advantage of clean coal 
over renewable vis-a-vis its social and economic costs.   
Answer: 
According to BP Energy Outlook, India’s energy consumption is set to grow 4.2% a year 
by 2035, faster than that of all major economies in the world.  
As per the IEA India Energy Outlook, 2015, over 40% of the primary energy demand in 
India is met by coal and less than 2% by renewable sources. The renewable sources are 
non-polluting and cheaper alternatives to coal in the long run but in the short and 
medium-term, the focus should be on clean coal technologies or high  efficiency  low 
emission  (HELE)  technologies such as supercritical and ultra-supercritical combustion 
technologies because of involved social and economic costs. 
Economic costs 
• There’s an abundance of coal availability in India. 
• Shift  to  renewables  would  leave  conventional  power  plants  underutilised.  The 
investments made in these plants would be deemed “sunk” and would result in loss 
of revenue. These stranded assets will impact the banking sector. 
• It costs Rs. 875 to reduce a tonne of CO2 emission when power is generated by 
ultra-supercritical power plants instead of subcritical plants while it costs Rs. 2,624 
to  reduce  a  tonne  of  CO2  emission  when  power  is  generated  by  SPV  (solar 
photovoltaic) plants instead of subcritical plants.  
• To  reduce  CO2  emissions  substantially,  50%  of  existing  subcritical  plants  can  be 
replaced by highly efficient ultra- supercritical plants. By doing this, the government

Student Notes: 
can save up to Rs. 25,000 crores as compared to the equivalent reduction of CO2 
emission by SPV power plants  
Social Costs 
• Low tariffs seen in the renewable sector do not include several implicit costs that 
are so far being subsidized such as cost of intermittent supply of power from solar 
and wind sources, land acquisition costs etc. 
• Investing in renewable energy attributes a social cost (such as opportunity cost of 
land required for solar) of Rs 11 per unit of electricity, three times to that of coal. 
• It will impact employment, and regional economies where coal mines are located. 
• Other  sources  such  as  wind  and  hydro-power  have  socio-economic  costs.  For 
example, it takes 4 to 5 years for a coal thermal project to fructify, unless it is held 
up. It would take 8 to 10 years for a hydro project to be commissioned. 
• This posturing of renewable alternatives such as run-of-the-river small hydropower 
as environmentally benign obscures the threat they pose to aquatic life, agriculture, 
irrigation, land, and traditional livelihoods. 
India must progressively increase her share of the burden to combat climate change, 
compared with other countries who should shoulder a higher burden from the outset. 
The social costs of coal should include its domestic externalities, but at least for some 
time, not the international externalities.  
India has a world class indigenous manufacturing capability of super critical coal based 
thermal power with a substantial portion of this capacity lying idle at present. This asset 
cannot be wasted. The imperative is to generate thermal power efficiently and in an 
environmentally safe manner.  
 
9. There  are  many  challenges  in  sustainably  scaling  up  renewable  energy  in  India. 
Analyse. Also, discuss what can be done to address these challenges. 
Approach: 
• Briefly write about the existing renewable energy scenario and intended targets 
related to it. 
• Bring out the challenges in making renewable energy sustainably in India. 
• Discuss some of the measures taken by government in this direction. 
• Finally bring out some measures that can be taken to address these challenges. 
Answer: 
The government of India has set up a target of installing 175 GW capacity of renewable 
energy by 2022. Out of 175 GW, 100 GW is to come from solar capacity and 60 GW 
from wind. As of Feb, 2018, a total capacity of 65 GW has been installed in the country. 
However, India faces many challenges in scaling up renewable energies such as:  
• Transmission  infrastructure: It is far from prepared to handle the kind of solar 
power being injected. 
• Less  demand  from  consumers: Renewable  energy  in  India  is  driven  more  by 
targets, governmental supports and simple economics than a consumer push for 
being green.  
• Inability to meet peak demand: Variabilities in sun rays and blowing wind may not 
help  meet  the  peak  demand  by  contributing  capacity  at  the  right  time.  Also, 
fluctuation in output due to climatic conditions leads to instability of the power grid 
infrastructure and may lead to its failure. 
• Low  prices: Falling solar prices is also a problem and DISCOMS don’t want to be 
locked into a bad deal.

Student Notes: 
• Technological  barriers: Concerns related to panel quality and lifespan especially in 
the hot tropical Indian conditions. 
• Low investments: Need of more investment is stifled by inability to attract private 
players as well as high interest rates. 
Government  has  taken  a  number  of  measures  to  promote  renewable  energy  like 
provisions of Renewable Purchase Obligations, development of solar parks and Ultra 
Mega solar power projects, development of power transmission through Green Energy 
Corridor projects, permitting 100 percent FDI through automatic route etc. 
To tackle the challenges more measures are required such as:  
• Transparency  in  pricing: There  is  need  to  address  the  system  level  costs  of 
Renewable energy in a more transparent manner. 
• Enhance  grid  capacity: More  focus  on  the  smart  grids and  demand  response 
system for robust transmission system as well as quick digitization of grids in all 
states should be a priority.  
• Improve transmission: Green Energy Corridor needs to be significantly widened so 
as to accommodate 50 more ultra-mega solar parks. Also, cross-state Renewable 
energy power flows should be made easier since it would be concentrated in 
handful of windy and sunny states. 
• Better  regulation:  By  developing  expertise  among  decision-makers,  increasing 
coordination between relevant authorities as well as developing holistic regulatory 
and infrastructural strategy using resource assessment and mapping. 
• Skill  development: Lack of technical skills for grid operation and management 
should be tackled by creating a comprehensive capacity-building plan. 
Thus,  an  ecosystem  is  needed  to  be  created  through  partnerships  between 
government, utilities and developers to ensure significant scaling up of renewables. 
 
10. What is Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)? Explaining the need of ITS in India, 
identify the challenges in deploying it. 
Approach: 
• Explain Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and how it improves the quality of 
life.  
• Highlight the need for deploying ITS. 
• Issues being faced in deploying ITS in developing countries like India.

Student Notes: 
• Address increasing congestion, which is raising travel times and industry costs. For 
ex-Traffic Signal Priority for Buses and Automatic Vehicle Tracking System focuses 
on analysis of data for adjusting transit schedules 
• Make  available  real-time  information to  commuters  and  agencies,  helping  in 
better travel planning and traffic management, saving man-hours and energy, thus 
providing a sustainable solution 
• Enhance the attractiveness of public transport  
• Reduce the environmental impacts of transport  
• Improve the competitiveness and performance of freight logistics systems 
Issues being faced in deploying ITS in developing countries like India are following: 
• Technology: electronic equipment such as sensors, detectors and communication 
devices etc. need to be developed; also developing a comprehensive data collection 
system would be a challenge.. 
• Modelling  of  Indian  traffic – a proper understanding of the traffic system for 
building a reliable ITS systems.  
• Supply  Chain:  seamless  interconnectivity  of  the  various  branches  of  the 
transportation sector for effective, efficient and secure movement of goods and 
services. 
• Energy  and  Sustainability: It should closely work with the energy sector in the 
promotion of fuel efficient transport policies and practices. 
• Human  Capital  Development: a work force that can develop, manage and safely 
implement existing and emerging technologies 
• Standards: establishing ITS standards applicable throughout the urban and rural 
sections of India  
• Managing  heterogeneity: designing an ITS that encompasses the heterogeneous 
vehicle population  
• Collaboration: Setting  up  active  interaction  between  academia,  industries  and 
governmental agencies  
• Regulation: setting  up  rules  and  regulations  of  traffic  that  will  aid  in  ITS 
implementation 
While India has already made a foray into intelligent transport systems in organizing 
traffic, more extensive and urgent integration of advanced technology and concepts 
into mainstream traffic management is the need of the hour. This requires establishing 
aggressive, yet achievable, near and long-term performance goals for transportation 
systems.

Student Notes: 
The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) consists of the projects and programmes with 
a total allocation of INR 102 lakh crore for infrastructure development in the next five 
years. 
Features of NIP: 
• It includes economic and social infrastructure projects in sectors such as Energy 
(24%), Roads (19%), Urban (16%), and Railways (13%), amounting to around 70% of 
the projected capital expenditure in infrastructure in India. Investment in different 
sectors will help in focused development of each sector under the umbrella of this 
programme. 
• The Centre (39%) and states (39%) are expected to have equal share of the capital 
expenditure to be undertaken in the infrastructure sector, followed by the private 
sector (22%). 
• Each Ministry/ Department would be responsible for the monitoring of projects so 
as to ensure their timely and within-cost implementation. 
• It has also suggested important reforms such as improving project preparation 
processes, enhancing execution capacity of private sector participants, financial 
sector reforms etc. 
India's  infrastructure  bottleneck  is  a  primary  constraint  to  improving  its  global 
competitiveness,  as  measured  by  the World   Economic   Forum's   Global 
Competitiveness  Index. In the same index, India is currently ranked 70 out of 140 
countries for its infrastructure quality. And in order to improve the living standards and 
fulfill  SDG  9,  India  needs  to  develop  quality,  reliable,  sustainable  and  resilient 
infrastructure,  including  regional  and  trans-border  infrastructure.  The  National 
Infrastructure Pipeline , therefore, holds  crucial importance. 
Significance  of  NIP  in  the  context  of  projected  trends  in  Indian  economy  and 
demography: 
• Trends in Indian Economy 
o Shift to services-based economy: It is estimated that the share of services in 
total employment in India will grow from 27% in 2012 to 48% in 2030. NIP will 
play a critical role in boosting the service sector by providing it with adequate 
and efficient infrastructure. 
o Increasing  unemployment: Infrastructure creation is labour absorbing, which 
boosts employment and income generation in the economy and further spurs 
domestic demand. 
o Logistics and Road connectivity: Improved infrastructure capacities also create 
efficiency gains through improved logistics and networks, which would improve 
the competitiveness of the economy. This can help kick in a virtuous cycle of 
higher investments, growth and employment generation in the economy. 
o Impact on other programs: Creating new and upgrading existing infrastructure 
can specially be critical for the success of other programs like ‘Make in India’ 
program as manufacturing competitiveness critically depends on infrastructure. 
• Demographic trends 
o Growing  working-age  population: It  is  expected  that  the  working-age 
population of India will grow 1.2 times during 2015-2030. India is expected to 
have  the  world’s  largest  working-age  population  of  1.03  billion  by  2030 
compared with 0.97 billion in China and 0.22 billion in the US. Employment 
generated due to NIP will be crucial in this scenario. 
o Increasing  urbanization: By 2030, it is estimated that around 42% of India’s 
population would be urbanised from the current 31%.

process of urbanisation by promoting ease of living and will help in realizing the 
full potential of growing urban economy and raise its contribution to GDP. 
The  changing  trends  in  the  economy  and  demographics  will  need  the  converged 
development of a host of infrastructure facilities. So, the NIP will help in delivering the 
full spectrum of required infrastructure, which will ensure economic growth, ease of 
living as well as improved competitiveness across sectors. 
 
12. In a power-deficit country like India, energy efficiency can be a new kind of power, 
with savings from energy efficiency driving the economic growth. Discuss. 
Approach: 
• Substantiate the power deficiency in India and energy efficiency is a solution to it. 
• Describe/analyze various steps/schemes/initiatives taken by government/industries 
for energy conservation/efficiency. 
Answer: [Student Note: Answer has been kept long to provide details of various schemes and 
facets of energy efficiency dimension.] 
 India suffers from a major shortage of electricity generation capacity currently. She 
faced a power deficit of 12,000 MW during peak hours in the 2012-13 financial year. 
Barring very few states, all states are affected by the power shortage. India imports 
natural gas, coal for its power generation. High economic growth along with increasing 
urbanization, industrialization and an emerging consumer society are putting pressure 
on power generation. Each of these challenges can be addressed effectively by making 
energy efficiency a central plank in the country’s long-term growth planning. 
 Almost every sector of the economy – industrial, agricultural, commercial and domestic 
– has  potential  of  energy  efficiency.  India’s  National  Mission  for  Enhanced  Energy 
Efficiency (NMEEE) targets to replace new electricity capacity addition of 19000 MW by 
2014-15 using enhancing energy efficiency measures. 
There are various industries which are energy intensive such as steel plants, paper 
manufacturing factories, cement units etc. Government of India along with private 
sector  has  initiated  various  schemes,  programmes  to  design  energy  saving  norms, 
generating human resource and using state of the art technology for maximizing energy 
efficiency. Under Perform Achieve Trade (PAT) scheme, eight energy intensive sectors 
are  obliged  to  reduce  their  energy  consumption.  They  have  to  buy  energy  saving 
certificates (EScerts) to jump over the assigned emission targets. Energy-intensive SMEs 
(small and Medium Enterprises) in India are still having old machinery. With proper 
technological and managerial intervention, energy consumption can be reduced by 
more than 25 per cent in most of these SMEs. Bureau  of  Energy  Efficiency  (BEE) in 
consultation with state agencies has prepared action plan to enhance energy efficiency.  
Energy  audit  studies  conducted  in  several office    building,  hotels &  hospitals  
indicate energy   saving potential  of  23%  to 46%  in  end  uses  like lighting,  HVAC  
etc. 
The  government  of  India  launched  Energy  Conservation Building  Code  (ECBC)    on  
27th  May ,  2007  to  set minimum energy  standards  for  commercial  buildings having 
a threshold load (500 kW). Mandatory compliance  of  the  ECBC  is  expected  to  yield  
annual saving  of  approximately  1.7  billion  units. 
Central  and  state  governments  have  come  up  with  various  schemes  to  replace 
inefficient appliances from houses. Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY), under the supervision of

BEE, targets replacement  of  about  400-million  incandescent  bulbs  in use  in  the  
country ,  leading  to  a  possible  reduction  of about  6,000  MW of  electricity  
demand. Cost of BLY is achieved by utilizing the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) 
of the Kyoto Protocol. Standards and labeling scheme is  to  provide  the consumer   an   
informed choice about energy saving,  and  thereby  the  cost  saving  potential  of  the  
marketed  household and other equipment. Star rating scheme for refrigerators, Air 
Conditioners (ACs) is a win-win situation for consumers and government as extra price 
of an appliance is compensated by electricity saved.  
There  is  an  immense  opportunity  in  reducing    the  overall    power    consumption,  
improving  efficiencies  of  ground  water  extraction  and  reducing  the  subsidy burden  
of  the  states  without  sacrificing  the  service obligation  to  agricultural  sector. 
Studies  project  potential  savings of  45-50%  by  mere replacement  of  inefficient  
pumps from  fields,    the    overall  electricity  savings    (from    20  million  pumps)  is  
estimated  at  62.1  billion  units  annually. In addition to that, there is a need to 
incentivize farmers to run irrigation pump for only require time period to save extra 
energy that gets wasted.  
Government has started National Campaign on Energy Conservation in 2005 to  make  
people  aware  about  the  need  of  energy conservation  and  benefits  to  the  
individual,    society  and  nation  as  a  whole.  Campaign  is  targeting  the  domestic, 
commercial,  agricultural,  industrial  and  educational  sector.  Government  is also 
promoting  energy  conservation  through National  Energy  Conservation  Awards 
scheme. These  Awards  are  a  means  to  institutionalize  the energy  efficiency  
movement  in  the  country  by identifying  and  giving  recognition  to  the  energy 
conservation  efforts  undertaken  by  different  firms and  industries. 
In conclusion, power-deficit India has to work at multi-platforms to meet the growing 
demand  of  energy.  Conserving  power  through  enhanced  efficiency  is  a  long-term 
solution  where  people,  industry  and  government  sectors  become  more  sensitive 
towards energy efficiency. Without such drive, India would be under immense pressure 
to meet the growing energy demand. 
 
13. “In India, tertiary roads are given tertiary treatment”. In this context, elaborate on 
the importance of developing rural roads in the country. Also highlight the success of 
PMGSY in ushering the much-needed bottom-up reforms. 
Approach: 
The statement tries to give a negative connotation but students need to highlight the 
existing poor state of rural roads in the country in brief. In the later part they should 
elaborate on importance of rural roads and successes of PMGSY.  There is no need to 
cite the provision of PMGSY 
Answer: 
• Even  after  a  decade,  a  large  number  of  villages and habitations in rural areas 
remain unconnected due to lack of good quality roads. Around 44% of the rural 
population is not covered by the rural road network.  
• The  lack  of  roads  means  that  an  estimated  20-30  percent  of  the  agricultural, 
horticultural and forest produce gets wasted because of inability to timely transport 
the produce to marketing and processing centres 
• Rural roads comprise over 85 % of the road network and their being kept in 
serviceable condition is crucial to the rural / agricultural growth and affording 
means of access to millions of rural people to social facilities viz. medical, education

as well as to market. Lack of maintenance affects the poor people badly as the time 
for access to markets and other social infrastructure is increased. 
• Rural  roads  have  been  proved  to  be  catalytic  for  economic  development  and 
poverty alleviation in rural areas 
Success of PMGSY: 
• Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) roads have resulted in significant 
benefits to rural households in form of easier access to health and educational 
facilities. 
• It has enhanced school enrolment of students, and attendance of students and 
teachers. The road connectivity has increased the mobility of women as they can 
now travel alone in buses and cycles. 
• One of the major benefits is access to markets, which increases employment and 
business opportunities, and encourages small-scale and cottage industry activities, 
roadside stalls, and shops in the villages. It has created employment opportunities 
to local people of around 460 million man days per year. 
• Better roads have meant availability of irrigation facilities like bore pumps and use 
of tractors, enabling multiple cropping and efficient farming. Dairy and poultry 
farmers have also benefited. Roads have enhanced rural employment—both on- 
and off farm and encouraged setting up of small enterprises, including those by 
women. 
• Rural infrastructure investments have benefitted the rural poor through increased 
incomes and improved consumption patterns.

Incremental Capital-Output Ratio 
The  incremental  capital  output  ratio 
(ICOR)  is  a  metric  that  assesses  the 
marginal    amount    of    investment 
capital   necessary   for   an   entity   to 
generate the next unit of 
production. For    example,    suppose 
that  Country  X  has  an  incremental 
capital  output  ratio  (ICOR)  of  10.  This 
implies   that   $10   worth   of capital 
investment is  necessary  to  generate 
$1 of extra production. 
1.	Models	Used	in	the	Planning	Process	
Growth in GDP is not the only determinant of economic development, which in order to be 
measured effectively must account for human welfare determinants such as life expectancy, 
literacy rates, child mortality rates, distribution of income, and so on. However, it has been 
shown throughout history that economic growth, or the increase in real output and income, 
correlates directly with improvements in development factors like those above. And to achieve 
fast paced economic growth we need appropriate growth models, some of which are discussed 
below: 
1.1.	Harrod	–	Domar	Growth	Model	
Harrod  and  Domar  analyzed  the  dynamic  nature  of 
investment and demand and showed how variations in 
capital and in demand were responsible for instability 
in  economic  growth.  Therefore,  this  model  suggests 
that  the  economy’s  growth  rate  depends  on  two 
factors:  
• Level of savings; and  
• Productivity of investment i.e. Capital to Output 
ratio. 
Hence the rate of economic growth in a country depends on the rate of investment and capital-
output ratio. Harrod and Domar arrived at the following relation: 
    Growth Rate = Investment * (1/Capital-Output Ratio) 
Relevance of Harrod-Domar Model for Developing Countries 
Harrod-Domar  model  was  formulated  primarily  to  protect  the  developed  countries  from 
chronic unemployment and they were not meant to provide guidelines to the developing 
economies  in  their  economic  development.  Since  they  were  formulated  primarily  for  the 
developed countries they were based on high propensity to save and a correct estimate of the 
capital-output ratio, which should remain fixed over time. On the other hand, the main problem 
of the under-developed countries is to raise their propensity to save because it is generally low 
in these countries. Nor is it possible to assume a fixed value of the capital-output ratio. This 
ratio happens to be very high in these countries. Thus the two important bases of the Harrod-
Domar model are non-existent in the case of developing economies.  
Thus the  peculiar  conditions  prevailing  in  the  developing  countries  e.g.  disguised 
unemployment, low propensity to save and low productive capacity makes the Harrod-Domar 
model inapplicable to them. Also, this model assumes no government intervention, fixed prices 
and no institutional changes. All these assumptions too make it inappropriate.  
However, we should not reject this model wholesale and emphasize their inapplicability to 
developing economies. With slight modifications and reinterpretation they can be made to 
furnish suitable guidelines even for the developing economies. In some cases, it is only a 
question  of  changing  the  emphasis.  For  instance,  Domar’s  model  recognizes  the  capacity 
creating role of investment. But it is intended to increase effective demand in developed 
countries, while in developing countries, the capacity creating role of investment is to be seen 
as a means of overcoming the problem of unemployment. Hence, to make the model applicable 
to the developing countries, it has to be suitably reinterpreted.

1.2.	Mahalanobis	Strategy	of	Economic	Growth	
There has been a lot of controversy in our country on the appropriate strategy to be adopted 
for planned economic development. There was no clear strategy in the First Five-Year Plan. But 
when the second plan was being formulated Prof. P.C Mahalanobis prepared a growth model in 
which he showed that to achieve a self-sustained growth quickly in the country, it would be

Student Notes: 
essential to devote a major part of the development outlay to building basic heavy industry, e.g. 
of capital goods industry like steel and the engineering industry for making different types of 
machines, the multipurpose river valley projects for irrigation and power. 
According to Prof. Mahalanobis, the rate of real capital formation in a country like India did not 
depend merely on savings in the form of money but it depends on the capacity for making 
capital goods. He argued that even if the rate of savings was substantially raised and it was 
desired to accelerate economic growth and capital formation by investing it in the consumer 
goods industries, it would be futile. The reason is that the capital goods required for the 
consumer goods industries are not produced in the country in sufficient quantities. 
Thus, Prof. Mahalanobis was of the view that if large investment is not made in the heavy basic 
and capital goods industry, the country will forever remain dependent on foreign countries for 
the imports of steel and capital goods like machinery for economic development and real 
capital formation. Since it is not possible for India to earn sufficient foreign exchange for the 
purpose by increasing exports, the capital goods cannot be imported in sufficient owing to 
foreign exchange constraints. The result will be that the rate of economic growth and the rate 
of real capital formation in the country will be slow indeed.  Thus according to him, to achieve 
rapid economic growth and self-reliance, it would be necessary to give a high priority to basic 
and capital goods industries in the development strategy of a plan.  
1.3.	Planning	Model	Adopted	in	India	
The second five year plan was based on the Nehru-Mahalanobis strategy of development, 
which guided the planning practice for more than three decades until the end of the Seventh 
Five Year Plan. The draft outline of this plan was based on the Mahalanobis Model which was 
viewed as a variant of the Soviet Planning model.  The basic elements of this strategy can be 
summed up as: 
• Raising the rate of investment since the rate of development is dependent on the rate of 
investment. It involved stepping up domestic and foreign savings also 
• Rapid growth of the productive capacity of the economy by directing public investment 
toward development of industries. E.g. Five steel plants were setup in remote places like 
Bhilai, Durgapur, and Rourkela in the second plan.  
• Simultaneously, promotion of labor-intensive, small and cottage industries.  
• Import substitution for self-reliance. E.g. Green revolution was brought up in to advance 
the agricultural production.  
• An elaborate system of controls and industrial licensing. E.g. Legislations such as MRTP and 
FERA were used to regulate the economic activity.  
• Predominance of public sector in capital goods industries 
2.	Infrastructure	Investment	Models	
2.1.	Financing	of	Infrastructure:	Need,	Issue	and	Challenges	
The relationship between infrastructure development and economic growth is well established 
in  the  literature.  While  infrastructure  development  facilitates  economic  growth;  economic 
growth increases demand for more infrastructure. Thus, development of adequate and quality 
infrastructure is a necessary if not sufficient condition to maintain growth momentum in any 
economy.  However, infrastructure development is an arduous job for any country as it involves 
huge investments, long gestation periods, procedural delays and returns spread over a long 
period of time. These unique features of infrastructure development raise some issues which 
are specific to the financing of infrastructure. 
To  revert  back  to  the  high  economic  growth  rate  (8-9%) in  next  five  years,  the  rate  of 
investment  has  to  increase  substantially  (We  need  1  Trillion  Dollars  of  investment  in 
infrastructure in next two to three years- National Investment and Infrastructure Fund). This is

Student Notes: 
evidenced by the decline of growth rate and investment rate in last couple of years. Let us look 
at the broad pattern of financing of infrastructure in our country before highlighting some of 
the issues involved in it. 
2.2.	Issues	in	Infrastructure	Financing	
• Funding Gap - Funding Gap is the most important issue that we face on this front. The 
slowdown in the economy has further aggravated this funding gap in the infrastructure 
sector.  
• Fiscal Burden - Almost half of the total investment in the infrastructure sector was done by 
the Government through budget allocations. But the Government funds have competing 
demands, such as, education, health, employment generation, among others. 
• Asset-Liability Mismatch of Commercial Banks - After the budgetary support, next in line 
for financing infrastructure were funds from the commercial banking sector.  However, it is 
a well-known fact that these are institutions that primarily leverage on short-term liabilities 
and, as such, their ability to extend long-term loans to the infrastructure sector is limited. 
This is because, by doing so they get into serious asset-liability mismatches. 
• Investment Obligations of Insurance and Pension Funds - From the point of view of asset-
liability mismatches, insurance and pension funds are one of the best suited institutions to 
invest in the infrastructure sector. This is because, in contrast to the commercial banking 
sector, these institutions leverage on long-term liabilities. However, they are constrained by 
their obligation to invest a substantial portion of their funds in Government securities. Of 
course,  in  a  way,  this  facilitates  the  financing  of  gross  fiscal  deficit  of  the  Central 
Government  and  hence  enables  the  Central  Government  to  make  more  investments. 
However, this limits the direct investment of these institutions in the infrastructure sector 
• Need for an Efficient and Vibrant Corporate Bond Market - An active corporate bond 
market can facilitate long-term funding for the infrastructure sector. However, despite the 
various initiatives taken by the Reserve Bank, Securities & Exchange Board of India and 
Government of India, the corporate bond market is still a long way to go in providing 
adequate financing to the infrastructure sector in India. 
• Developing Municipal Bond Market for Financing Urban Infrastructure -For large scale 
financing urban infrastructure which is assuming critical importance in the context of rapid 
urbanization, conventional fiscal transfers to the urban local bodies or municipals from 
governments are no longer considered sufficient. 
As  a  result,  there  have  been  some  earnest  experimentations  by  these  bodies  to  tap 
unconventional methods of financing such as public private partnerships (PPPs), utilizing 
urban  assets  more  productively,  accessing  carbon  credits,  etc.  but  then  these  do  not 
address the financing needs. One possible way of addressing the problem is developing a 
municipal bond market. 
• Insufficiency of User Charges - It is a well-known fact that a large part of the infrastructure 
sector  in  India  (especially  irrigation,  water  supply,  urban  sanitation,  and  state  road 
transport) is not amenable to commercialization for various reasons, such as, regulatory, 
political and legal constraints in the real sector. Due to this, Government is not in a position 
to levy sufficient user charges on these services. The insufficiency of user charges on 
infrastructure projects negatively affect the servicing of the infrastructure loans. Generally, 
such loans are taken on a non-recourse basis and are highly dependent on cash flows. 
Hence, levy and collection of appropriate user charges becomes essential for financial 
viability of the projects. 
• Legal and Procedural Issues - Infrastructure development involves long gestation periods, 
and  also  many  legal  and  procedural  issues.  The  problems  related  to  infrastructure 
development range from those relating to land acquisition for the infrastructure project to 
environmental clearances for the project. Many a times there are legal issues involved in it 
and these increase procedural delays.

2.3.	Measures	Taken	by	the	Government	
• Public-Private Partnership Projects in Infrastructure - As Government faces a tight budget 
constraint in the context of a rule based fiscal policy framework, it was important to 
encourage the private sector to invest more in the infrastructure sector. Resultantly, the 
Government  started  encouraging  Public-Private  Partnership  (PPP)  projects  in  the 
infrastructure sector. PPP mechanism provides built in credit enhancement for improving 
project viability by way of buyback guarantee, escrow arrangement, substitution rights for 
the lenders, etc. Government has taken several initiatives, especially to standardize the 
documents and process for structuring and award of PPP projects. This has improved 
transparency in relation to the issues involved in setting up  PPP projects.   
• Viability Gap Funding Viability gap funding was introduced in 2006, which provides Central 
Government grants up to 20 per cent of the total capital cost to PPP projects undertaken by 
any central ministry, state government, statutory entity, or local body. The scheme aimed at 
providing upfront capital grant to PPP projects to enable financing of commercially unviable 
projects. The level of grant is the net present value of the gap between the project cost and 
estimated revenue generation over the concession period based on a user fee that was to 
be levied in a pre-determined manner. 
• Foreign Direct Investment and Infrastructure Development - To  facilitate  infrastructure 
financing 100 per cent FDI is allowed under the automatic route in some of the sectors such 
as mining, power, civil aviation sector, construction and development projects, industrial 
parks, petroleum and natural gas sector, telecommunications and special economic zones. 
Further, FDI is also allowed through the Government approval route in some sectors such as 
civil  aviation  sector,  Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas  sector – refining  PSU  companies; 
Telecommunications etc. 
• Setting  up  of  India  Infrastructure  Finance  Company  Limited  (IIFCL) - Another  major 
development was the setting up of IIFCL by the Central Government for providing long-term 
loans to  the  infrastructure  projects.  IIFCL  is  involved  both  in  direct  lending  to  project 
companies and refinancing of banks and other financial institutions. IIFCL can provide funds 
to the infrastructure project up to 20 per cent of the total project cost as long-term debt 
• Setting up of Infrastructure Debt Funds - Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) notified detailed guidelines for setting up of IDFs which can 
either  be  a  mutual  fund  (trusts)  (IDF-MF)  or  an  NBFC  (companies)  (IDF-NBFC).  The 
Scheduled commercial banks are allowed to act as sponsors to IDF-MFs and IDF-NBFCs with 
prior approval from RBI subject to certain terms and conditions.  
• Tapping the retail investor base through Infrastructure Bonds - To provide further impetus 
to  infrastructure  financing,  Government  of  India  has  permitted  IFCI,  IDFC,  LIC  and 
infrastructure  finance  firms  to  issue  long-term  infrastructure  bonds  providing  for  tax 
benefit.  
• Use  of  Foreign  Exchange  Reserves  for  Infrastructure  Development - Although  use  of 
reserves for such purposes does not meet the criterion of reserve management objectives, 
a special and limited window has been created. Accordingly, IIFC (UK) Ltd. was incorporated 
in London and was set up in April 2008. Under this scheme, RBI invests, in tranches, up to 
an aggregate amount of USD 5 billion in fully government guaranteed foreign currency 
denominated bonds issued by this overseas Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) of the IIFCL. The 
funds, thus raised, are to be utilized by the company for on-lending to the Indian companies 
implementing infrastructure projects in India and/or to co-finance the ECBs of such projects 
for capital expenditure outside India without creating any monetary impact. 
• Introduction of Credit Default Swaps - Further, the introduction of Credit Default Swaps 
(CDS) would help banks to manage exposures while increasing credit penetration, and 
lending to infrastructure and large firms without being constrained by the extant regulatory 
prescriptions in respect of single borrower gross exposure limits.

• Liberalization & Rationalization of ECB policies - The ECB limit for infrastructure has been 
raised to  promote investment in this sector. The minimum average maturity requirement 
for ECBs in the infrastructure space raised by eligible borrowers has been reduced to three 
years  from  earlier  five  years. Also, the average  maturity  requirement for  mandatory 
hedging has been reduced to five years from earlier ten years.  
• Establishing National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)- It is India’s first sovereign 
wealth fund that seeks to create long-term value for domestic and international investors 
seeking investment in energy, transportation, housing, water, waste management etc. in 
greenfield, brownfield and stalled projects. It has been set up as fund of funds and is 
registered with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The corpus of the fund is 
proposed to be around Rs. 40, 000 crore, with the government investing 49% and the rest 
to be raised from third-party investors such as sovereign wealth funds, insurance and 
pension funds. 
2.4.	Public-Private	Partnership	(PPP)	in	Infrastructure	
The partners in a PPP, usually through a legally binding contract or some other mechanism, 
agree to share responsibilities related to implementation and/or operation and management of 
an infrastructure project. This collaboration or partnership is built on the expertise of each 
partner that meets clearly defined public needs through the appropriate allocation of: 
• Resources 
• Risks 
• Responsibilities, and 
• Rewards 
2.4.1.	What	advantages	PPPs	may	provide?	
Governments worldwide have increasingly turned to the private sector to provide infrastructure 
services in energy and power, communication, transport and water sectors that were once 
delivered by the public sector. There are several reasons for the growing collaboration with the 
private sector in developing and providing infrastructure services, which include: 
• Increased efficiency in project delivery, and operation and management; 
• Availability of additional resources to meet the growing needs of investment in the sector; 
and 
• Access to advanced technology (both hardware and software). 
2.4.2.	How	a	PPP	project	is	different	from	a	conventional	project?	
There are significant differences between a conventional construction procurement project and 
a PPP project that need to be clearly understood. The main differences include: 
• PPP projects are different from conventional construction projects in terms of project 
development,  implementation,  and  management.  The  administrative  and  approval 
processes in the case of PPP projects are also different. 
• A PPP project is viable essentially when a robust business model can be developed. 
• The risk allocation between the partners is at the heart of any PPP contract design and is 
more  complex  than  that  of  a  conventional  construction  project.  Both  partners  should 
clearly understand the various risks involved and agree to an allocation of risks between 
them. 
• A PPP contract generally has a much longer tenure than a construction contract. Managing 
the relationship between the private company and the implementing agency over the 
contract tenure is vital for the success of a PPP project.

2.4.3.	Understanding	the	basic	structure	of	a	PPP	arrangement		
A typical PPP structure can be quite complex involving contractual arrangements between a 
number of parties, including the government, project sponsor, project operator, financiers, 
suppliers, contractors, engineers, third parties (such as an escrow agents), and customers. The 
creation of a separate commercial venture called a Special Purpose/Project Vehicle (SPV) is a 
key feature of most PPPs. The SPV is a legal entity that undertakes a project and negotiates 
contract agreements with other parties including the government. An SPV is also the preferred

mode of PPP project implementation in limited or non-recourse situations, where the lenders 
rely on the project’s cash flow and security over its assets as the only means to repay debts 
• The actual structure of a PPP, however, depends on the type of partnership model and can 
be  quite  complex  involving  contractual  arrangements  between  a  number  of  parties 
including  the  government,  project  sponsor,  project  operator,  financiers,  suppliers, 
contractors, engineers, third parties (for example, an escrow agent), and customers.  
• An SPV is usually set up by the private concessionaire/sponsor(s), who in exchange for 
shares representing ownership in the SPV contribute the long-term equity capital, and 
agree to lead the project. The SPV may not always be directly owned by the sponsors. They 
may use a holding company for this purpose. 
• An important characteristic of an SPV as a company is that it cannot undertake any business 
that is not part of the project. An SPV as a separate legal entity protects the interests of 
both  the  lenders  and  the  investors.  The  formation  of  an  SPV  has  also  many  other 
advantages. A project may be too large and complicated to be undertaken by one single 
investor considering its investment size, management and operational skills required and 
risks involved. In such a case, the SPV mechanism allows joining hands with other investors 
who could invest, bring in technical and management capacity and share risks, as necessary. 
• The government may also contribute to the long-term equity capital of the SPV in exchange 
of shares. In such a case, the SPV is established as a joint venture company between the 
public  and  private  sectors  and  the  government  acquires  equal  rights  and  equivalent 
interests to the assets within the SPV as other private sector shareholders. 
• Sometimes, governments want to ensure a continued interest (with or without controlling 
authority) in the management and operations of infrastructure assets such as a port or an 
airport  particularly  those  which  have  strategic  importance,  or  in  assets  that  require 
significant financial contribution from the government. In such a case, a joint venture may 
be established. A joint venture is an operating company owned by a government entity and 
a private company (or multiple companies including foreign companies if permitted by law), 
or a consortium of private companies. 
• Often, an SPV is formed as a joint venture between an experienced construction company 
and a service operations company capable of operating and maintaining the project. 
• Other than its strategic, financial and economic interest, the government may also like to 
directly participate in a PPP project. The main reasons for such direct involvement may 
include: 
o To hold interest in strategic assets;  
o To address political sensitivity and fulfil social obligations;  
o To ensure commercial viability of the project;  
o To provide greater confidence to lenders; and  
o To have better insight to protect public interest.  
Direct government involvement in a PPP project is usually guided by the legal and regulatory 
regime of the country and the government policy on PPPs. For example, the government may 
hold certain defined percentage of the stake in a strategic project such as an airport or a port.  
2.4.4.	Are	there	any	limitations	of	PPPs?	
There are many important economic, social, political, legal, and administrative aspects, which 
need to be carefully assessed before approvals of PPPs are considered by the government. PPPs 
have  various  limitations  which  should  also  be  taken  into  account  while  they  are  being 
considered. The major limitations include: 
• Not all projects are feasible (for various reasons: political, legal, commercial viability, etc.). 
• The private sector may not take interest in a project due to perceived high risks or may lack 
technical, financial or managerial capacity to implement the project.

Student Notes: 
• A PPP project may be more costly unless additional costs (due to higher transaction and 
financing costs) can be off-set through efficiency gains. 
• Change in operation and management control of an infrastructure asset, as has been the 
traditional BOT model. 
• PPP may not be sufficient to improve its economic performance unless other necessary 
conditions are met. These conditions may include appropriate sector and market reform, 
and change in operational and management practices of infrastructure operation. 
• Often, the success of PPPs depends on regulatory efficiency. 
2.4.5.	PPP	Initiatives	in	India	
The Government of India is promoting PPPs as an effective tool for bringing private-sector 
efficiencies in creation of economic and social infrastructure assets and for delivery of quality 
public services. India in recent years has emerged as one of the leading PPP markets in the 
world, because of several policy and institutional initiatives taken by the central government. By 
end December 2012 there were over 900 PPP projects in the infrastructure sector. These 
projects are at different stages of implementation, i.e. bidding, construction, and operational. 
2.4.6.	Models	of	PPP	
A wide spectrum of PPP models has emerged. These models vary mainly by: 
• Ownership of capital assets; 
• Responsibility for investment; 
• Assumption of risks; and 
• Duration of contract. 
The PPP models can be classified into following broad categories in order of generally (but not 
always) increased involvement and assumption of risks by the private sector. These categories 
are: 
• Supply and management contracts 
• Turnkey contracts 
• Affermage/Lease 
• Concessions 
• Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Private ownership. 
A categorization of the PPP models together with their main characteristics is shown in table 1. 
While  the  spectrum  of  models  shown  in  the  table  are  possible  as  individual  options, 
combinations are also possible such as, a lease or (partial) privatization contract for existing 
facilities which incorporates provisions for expansion through Build-Operate- Transfer. 
2.4.6.1. Supply and Management Contracts 
A management contract is a contractual arrangement for the management of a part or whole of 
a public enterprise (for example, a specialized port terminal for container handling at a port or a 
utility) by the private sector. Management contracts allow private sector skills to be brought 
into  service  design  and  delivery,  operational  control,  labour  management  and  equipment 
procurement. However, the public sector retains the ownership of facility and equipment. The 
private sector is assigned specified responsibilities concerning a service and is generally not 
asked to assume commercial risk. 
The private contractor is paid a fee to manage and operate services. Normally, the payment of 
such fees is performance-based. Usually, the contract period is short, typically three to five 
years. But the period may be longer for large and complex operational facilities such as a port 
or an airport.

Student Notes: 
Pros: 
• Can be implemented in a short time.  
• Least complex of all PPP models.  
• In some countries, politically and socially more acceptable for certain projects (such as 
water projects and strategic projects like ports and airports).  
Cons:  
• Efficiency gains may be limited and little incentive for the private sector to invest.  
• Almost all risks are borne by the public sector.  
• Applicable mainly to existing infrastructure assets.  
2.4.6.2. Turnkey  
Turnkey is a traditional public sector procurement model for infrastructure facilities. Generally, 
a private contractor is selected through a bidding process. The private contractor designs and 
builds a facility for a fixed fee, rate or total cost, which is one of the key criteria in selecting the 
winning bid. The contractor assumes risks involved in the design and construction phases. The 
scale of investment by the private sector is generally low and for a short-term. Typically, in this 
type of arrangement, there is no strong incentive for early completion of the project. This type 
of private sector participation is also known as Design-Build. 
Pros: 
• Well understood traditional model.  
• Contract agreement is not complex.  
• Generally, contract enforcement is not a major issue.  
Cons:  
• The private sector has no strong incentive for early completion.  
• All risks except those in the construction and installation phases are borne by the public 
sector.  
• Low private investment for a limited period.  
• Only limited innovation may be possible.  
2.4.6.3. Affermage/Lease  
In this category of arrangement, the operator (the leaseholder) is responsible for operating and 
maintaining  the  infrastructure  facility  (that  already  exists)  and  services,  but  generally  the 
operator is not required to make any large investment. However, often this model is applied in 
combination with other models such as build- rehabilitate-operate-transfer. In such a case, the 
contract period is generally much longer and the private sector is required to make significant 
investment.  
The arrangements in an affermage and a lease are very similar. The difference between them is 
technical. Under a lease, the operator retains revenue collected from customers/users of the 
facility  and  makes  a  specified  lease  fee  payment  to  the  contracting  authority.  Under  an 
affermage, the operator and the contracting authority share revenue from customers/users.  
In the affermage/lease types of arrangements, the operator takes lease of both infrastructure 
and equipment from the government for an agreed period of time. Generally, the government 
undertakes the responsibility for investment and thus bears investment risks. The operational 
risks are transferred to the operator. However, as part of the lease, some assets also may be 
transferred on a permanent basis for a period which extends over the economic life of assets. 
Fixed facilities and land are leased out for a longer period than for mobile assets. Land to be 
developed by the leaseholder is usually transferred for a period of 15-30 years.

Pros:  
• Can be implemented in a short time.  
• Significant private investment possible under longer term agreements. 
• In some countries, legally and politically more acceptable for strategic projects like ports 
and airports.  
Cons: 
• Has little incentive for the private sector to invest, particularly if the lease period is short.  
• Almost all risks are borne by the public sector.  
• Generally used for existing infrastructure assets.  
• Considerable regulatory oversight may be required.  
2.4.6.4. Concessions: BOT/BTO/BROT/BLT 
In this form of PPP, the government defines and grants specific rights to an entity (usually a 
private company) to build and operate a facility for a fixed period of time. The government may 
retain the ultimate ownership of the facility and/or right to supply the services. In concessions, 
payments can take place both ways: concessionaire pays to government for the concession 
rights and the government may pay the concessionaire, which it provides under the agreement 
to  meet  certain  specific  conditions.  Usually,  such  payments  by  the  government  may  be 
necessary to make projects commercially viable and/or reduce the level of commercial risk 
taken  by  the  private  sector,  particularly  in  a  developing  or  untested  PPP  market.  Typical 
concession periods range between 5 to 50 years.  
Pros:  
• Private sector bears a significant share of the risks.  
• High level of private investment. 
• Potential for efficiency gains in all phases of project development and implementation and 
technological innovation is high.  
Cons:  
• Highly complex to implement and administer.  
• Difficult to implement in an untested PPP market.  
• May have underlying fiscal costs to the government.  
• Negotiation between parties and finally making a project deal may require long time.  
• May require close regulatory oversight.  
• Contingent liabilities on government in the medium and long term 
2.4.6.4.1.	BOT	Model	
In a Build-Operate-Transfer  or  BOT type of concession (and its other variants namely, Build-
Transfer-Operate  (BTO), Build-Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer  (BROT),  Build-Lease-Transfer 
(BLT) type of arrangement), the concessionaire makes investments and operates the facility for 
a fixed period of time after which the ownership reverts back to the public sector. In a BOT 
model, operational and investment risks can be substantially transferred to the concessionaire. 
In a BOT model, the government has, however, explicit and implicit contingent liabilities that 
may arise due to loan guarantees and sub-ordinate loans provided, and default of a sub-
sovereign government and public or private entity on non- guaranteed loans. 
By retaining ultimate ownership, the government controls the policy and can allocate risks to 
parties that are best suited to assume or remove them. BOT projects may also require direct 
government support to make them commercially viable. The concessionaire’s revenue in a BOT 
project comes from managing and marketing of the user facilities (for example, toll revenue in a 
toll road project) and renting of commercial space where possible. Concessions for BOT projects 
can be structured on either maximum revenue share for a fixed concession period or minimum

Student Notes: 
concession  period  for  a  fixed  revenue  share,  a  combination  of  both,  or  only  minimum 
concession period. 
The problem of this model include the appropriate sharing of risks. In general, a project is 
financially viable for the private entity if the revenues generated by the project cover its cost 
and  provide  sufficient return  on  investment.  The  private  entity  is  expected  to  bring  the 
expertise and efficiency as well as the risk transfer. These are some types of the most common 
risks involved: 
• Political risk: especially in the developing countries because of the possibility of dramatic 
overnight political change. 
• Technical risk: construction difficulties, for example unforeseen soil conditions, breakdown 
of equipment 
• Financing risk: foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate fluctuation, market risk (change 
in  the  price  of  raw  materials),  income  risk  (over-optimistic  cash-flow  forecasts),  cost 
overrun risk.  
2.4.6.4.2.	BOOT	(build–own–operate–transfer)	
A BOOT structure differs from BOT in that the private entity owns the works. During the 
concession period the private company owns and operates the facility with the prime goal to 
recover the costs of investment and maintenance while trying to achieve higher margin on 
project. The specific characteristics of BOOT make it suitable for infrastructure projects like 
highways, roads mass transit, railway transport and power generation and as such they have 
political importance for the social welfare but are not attractive for other types of private 
investments. BOOT & BOT are methods which find very extensive application in countries which 
desire ownership transfer and operations including. Some advantages of BOOT projects are: 
• Encourage private investment 
• Inject new foreign capital to the country 
• Transfer of technology and know-how 
• Completing project within time frame and planned budget 
• Providing additional financial source for other priority projects 
• Releasing the burden on public budget for infrastructure development 
2.4.6.4.3.	BOO	(build–own–operate)	
In a BOO project ownership of the project remains usually with the project company for 
example a mobile phone network. Therefore, the private company gets the benefits of any 
residual value of the project. This framework is used when the physical life of the project 
coincides with the concession period. A BOO scheme involves large amounts of finance and 
long payback period. Some examples of BOO projects come from the water treatment plants. 
This facilities run by private companies process raw water, provided by the public sector entity, 
into  filtered  water,  which  is  after  returned  to  the  public  sector  utility  to  deliver  to  the 
customers. 
2.4.6.4.4.	BLT	(build–lease–transfer)	
Under BLT a private entity builds a complete project and leases it to the government. On this 
way the control over the project is transferred from the project owner to a lessee. In other 
words, the ownership remains by the shareholders but operation purposes are leased. After the 
expiry  of  the leasing the  ownership  of  the  asset  and  the  operational  responsibility  are 
transferred to the government at a previously agreed price. For foreign investors taking into 
account the country risk BLT provides good conditions because the project company maintains 
the property rights while avoiding operational risk.

Student Notes: 
2.4.6.5. Private Finance Initiative (PFI) Model 
• In  the  private  finance initiative  model,  the  private  sector  remains  responsible  for  the 
design, construction and operation of an infrastructure facility. In some cases, the public 
sector may relinquish the right of ownership of assets to the private sector. 
• In this model, the public sector purchases infrastructure services from the private sector 
through a long-term agreement. PFI projects, therefore, bear direct financial obligations to 
the government in any event. In addition, explicit and implicit contingent liabilities may also 
arise due to loan guarantees provided to the lenders and default of a public or private 
entity on non-guaranteed loans. A PFI project can be structured on minimum payment by 
the government over a fixed contract tenure, or minimum contract tenure for a fixed 
annual payment, or a combination of both payment and tenure. 
• In the PFI model, asset ownership at the end of the contract period is generally transferred 
to the public sector. Setting up of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) may not be always 
necessary. A PFI contract may be awarded to an existing company. For the purpose of 
financing, the lenders may, however, require the establishment of an SPV. The PFI model 
also has many variants. 
• In a PFI project, as the same entity builds and operates the services, and is paid for the 
successful supply of services at a pre-defined standard, the SPV / private company has no 
incentive to reduce the quality or quantity of services. This form of contractual agreement 
reduces the risks of cost overruns during the design and construction phases or of choosing 
an inefficient technology, since the operator’s future earnings depend on controlling the 
costs. The public sector’s main advantages lie in the relief from bearing the costs of design 
and construction, the transfer of certain risks to the private sector and the promise of 
better project design, construction and operation. 
Pros: 
• Private sector may bear a significant share of the risks. 
• High level of private investment. 
• Potential for efficiency gains and innovation is high. 
• Attractive to private investors in an untested or developing PPP market.  
• Most  suitable  for  social  sector  infrastructure  projects  (schools,  dormitories,  hospitals, 
community facilities, etc.). 
Cons: 
• Complex to implement and manage the contractual regimes.  
• Government has direct financial liability.  
• Negotiation between parties may require long time.  
• Regulatory efficiency is very important.  
• Contingent liabilities on the government in the medium and long term.  
2.4.7.	Contemporary	developments	
2.4.7.1. Swiss Challenge Model 
A Swiss challenge is a form of public procurement which requires a public authority which has 
received an unsolicited bid for a public project, to publish the bid and invite third parties to 
match or exceed it. Some Swiss challenges also allow the entity which submitted the unsolicited 
bid itself then to match or better the best bid which comes out of the Swiss challenge process. 
The  technique  was  used  for  the  development  of  Mega  Film  City  Venture  by  the Jaipur 
Development Authority (JDA). In 2017 Indian Railways also adopted Swiss challenge for inviting 
tenders for renovation of its 23 railway station.

Student Notes: 
Advantages  
• Competition: It allows the project to be put for competitive bidding and counter-bidding so 
to realize the optimum cost. 
• Transparency: Since the bidding and counter-bidding are open to challenge in this model, it 
promotes transparency and thereby helps in fixing the accountability. 
• Creativity: Since  this  model  allows  the  prospective  bidders  to  analyses  the  design 
submitted by their competitors and come out with better design, it promotes creative 
designing and project execution. 
Problems with this Model 
Concerns  are  raised  that  unsolicited  proposals  (or  the  Swiss  Challenge)  may  be  actively 
discouraged as they bring information asymmetries in the procurement process and result in 
lack of transparency and in the fair and equal treatment of potential bidders. It is because the 
opponent bidder may unnecessarily submit the counter proposal merely to create confusion. 
Governments need to have a strong legal and regulatory framework to award projects under 
the Swiss Challenge method. It can potentially foster crony capitalism, and allow companies 
space to employ dubious means to bag projects. Given that governments sometimes lack an 
understanding of risks involved in a project, direct negotiations with private players can be 
fraught with downsides.  
In general, competitive bidding is the best method to get the most value on public-private 
partnership projects. The government might also end up granting significant concessions in the 
nature of viability gap funding, commercial exploitation of real estate, etc., without necessarily 
deriving durable and long-term social or economic benefits. 
Suitability of Model to Indian situation 
As there is no strong legal framework in India, it is suggested that this method may not be 
adopted  for  large  scale  projects  where  such  projects  are  challenged  in  case  of  a  lack  of 
transparency or poor disclosures. Smaller projects can be awarded through this method. This 
method is more suitable to the projects where creativity and design and innovation are key 
determinants to project success. 
2.4.7.2. EPC MODEL 
Highway sector in India is responsible for job creation for millions of people and has a multiplier 
effect on the economy. Hence government took immediate measures to boost the sector by 
adopting EPC Model and the acronym stands for Engineering, Procurement and Construction. 
Engineering procurement and construction is the new system of private sector participation 
aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of PPP model. Under EPC model the contractor is legally 
responsible to complete the project under some fixed predetermined timeline and may also 
involve  scope  for  penalty  in  case  of  time  overrun.  But  the  entire  cost  is  borne  by  the 
government.  In  EPC  all  the  clearances,  land  acquisition  and  regulatory  norms  have  to  be 
completed by the government itself and the private players do not have to get itself involved in 
these time taking procedures. 
Specifically, in EPC model, 90% land is to be acquired and fund is transferred to the player 
before the starting of the project. Another set of distinctions are that it is to be completed in a 
predefined time frame, the risk of the project lies more on the contractors (turnkey project) and 
unlike PPP, the profit margin is fixed in this case. 
In PPP mode of project, operator was liable to build, operate and transfer the project to the 
government after completion while profit is to be acquired by either annuity paid or by levying 
toll.

Student Notes: 
How is EPC different and better than PPP? 
• Here the government bears the entire financial burden and funds the project. Capital is 
either raised by issuing bonds like NHAI bonds or by taking steps to secure road toll 
receivables post construction. Note that the fund here is not raised through banks, thereby 
saving banks from the risk of NPAs. Secondly, it relieves funds for the off take by other 
players in economy. 
• Government now takes care of clearances, acquiring land and estimating the traffic a very 
huge exercise that had to be done by private parties earlier. This reduces the risk for private 
player, thereby encouraging them to take up more projects. 
• With decreased risk on private builders and increased incentives for early completion, it 
creates comfortable base to lure investors to carry on the EPC work i.e. the contractor now 
designs the installation, procures the necessary materials and builds the project, either 
directly or by subcontracting part of the work.   
• Timeline required to construct reduces remarkably and there may even the clause of 
penalizing the private player for overshooting the timeline.  
• Here the government takes responsibility of raising capital, procuring clearances before the 
onset of the project. 
• EPC model is better than PPP model as the company gets the whole responsibility to 
complete  the  project  and  it  is  also  easy  for  the  government  to  hold  the  company 
accountable for the project. In PPP model various companies are involved in a single 
project. This creates the opportunity to start blame game if anything goes wrong after 
completion. 
The  decision  of  the  Government  of  India  to  develop,  operate  and  maintain  the  wayside 
amenities alongside National highways across India through EPC model is an example for an EPC 
project. 
Some issues with EPC model 
Under this system the entire project is funded by the government rather than shared by the 
private player as well. Sometimes it becomes problematic as under: 
• Financial burden on the government: In contrast to PPP where the private player shares 
the cost of project, thereby enabling the government to save its resources for other socio-
economic projects, in EPC the entire cost is borne by the government. Therefore, this model 
can’t be used always, especially when the government is facing budget deficits. 
• Lack of incentive to private players to reduce cost of project: It is because, here the nature 
of project is outsourcing by the government to private entity, which does not have incentive 
to reduce cost, as it doesn’t share the risks involved. In EPC the private entity is entitled to 
get pre-decided fixed amount akin to service charge, while the government takes all the 
risk. Therefore, this model is used only when the private players lack adequate financial 
resources, or investment sentiments are bleak, where the government has to intervene.  
This model was used recently when projects under PPP were stuck at different stages of 
completion and new investment was not coming. For example, due to reduced private sector 
participation, Govt. has increasingly resorted to EPC in 2013-14 and 2014-15.  
But in view of the high fiscal deficit this model is unsustainable. As a result, efforts are being 
made to adopt a hybrid model, which borrows the advantages of both the PPP Model and EPC 
Model, called Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM). 
2.4.7.3. Hybrid Annuity Model 
The new hybrid model is a mix of the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) and the 
BOT  models.  In  the  annuity  mode,  the  concessionaire  gets  a  fixed  and  more  importantly 
assured payment from the government.

Salient Features  
• Assured return: This assured return frees the concessionaire’s dependency on the toll 
collected  on  the  highway.  The  government  shoulders  the  responsibility  of  revenue 
collection.  
• Land: The government will provide 90 per cent of land and the related environment and 
forest clearance (earlier 80 per cent). 
• Operation  and  Maintenance:  The  balance  of  60  per  cent  needs  to  come  from  the 
concessionaire.  Operation  and  maintenance  of  the  toll  road  also  rests  with  the 
concessionaire. 
 
Advantages of this Model 
• According to industry experts, hybrid model is viable and companies see value in bidding 
for such projects.

Student Notes: 
• In the hybrid annuity model, one need not bring 100 per cent of finance upfront and since 
40 per cent is available during the construction period, only 60 per cent is required to be 
arranged for the long term. 
• Moreover, there is no risk of tolling as well as traffic uncertainty.  
• The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will collect toll and refund the amount in 
installments over a period of 15-20 years, cutting down on upfront investment required to 
be made by the government.  
• Developers will start participating in this type of projects, otherwise, the enterprise and 
lenders have practically no appetite for BOT projects and it should also give impetus to 
active private sector participation. 
o Further, 40 per cent grant in form of capital support would substantially reduce the 
debt portion and interest thereof. The lenders will have a great comfort in financing the 
project.  
• Land Acquisition and Environmental clearances: are major sources of delay and stalling of 
many projects. In HAM model, the obligation to acquire land and environmental clearances 
lies with the government. 
• Projects speeded up: Losses due to time overruns are prevented. As government is itself a 
stakeholder, it now acts as a real ‘partner’.  
• Sensible risk and reward sharing 
• Investment burden shared: Since corporate bank balance sheets are weak, private players 
cannot bear full capital investment burden. (HAM has 40% investment from govt.) 
• Higher revenue certainty and reduced risk of developer: In the BOT model, private partner 
bears the construction and maintenance risks. As Government is going to collect Highway 
toll tax in HAM, government also bears the risk.  
• Monitoring mechanism: as government will invest money in five equal installments based 
on the targeted completion of the road project. 
• Cost overruns: tackled due to provisions for inflation adjusted project costs. 
Need of this Model 
Under the existing public private partnership model called build-operate-transfer, the developer 
absorbs most of the risks—financial, operations and maintenance and revenue. Developers 
have shied away from the BOT (build operate and transfer) model due to the slowdown in the 
economy, which not only hampered fund-raising, but also hit toll collection, due to lower traffic 
flow. The poor cash flows burdened existing projects’ ability to service debt. 
With this new model, the idea is to provide a transparent, time-bound mechanism to fast-track 
decision  making  and  anticipating  solutions  to  issues  that  could  arise  through  a  built-in 
approach. 
Challenges in this Model 
• HAM is still a new model. So government should test it, improve it and refine it, before it 
goes big. (There are 28 projects approved under HAM, worth more than 36,000 cr.) 
• Participation has to be increased more to start the positive feedback loop, where old 
contractors return. Then more participation and competition will increase the confidence.  
Notwithstanding these issues this model presents a healthy mix of the existing models, taking 
their positives. Currently, this seems to be the solution for fast track execution of projects 
amidst the pessimistic business sentiments.

Student Notes: 
• Under PPP, capital completely or partly was to be raised by private player through issuing 
private equity bonds and borrowing from banks.  
• But, due to delayed implementation, private players weren't able to pay back loan in time 
adding to NPA in banks, eventually instigating many banks to stop lending loans 
• Delayed implementation also affected fund raising through private equities as they couldn't 
find investors for new ventures 
• Another area where private players faced difficulty was in assessing the traffic on roads and 
subsequent designing of roads. 
Above major problems over stretched the balance sheets of builders and led them exiting 
projects.  
2.4.9. Way Forward 
Global experience indicates that PPPs work well when they combine the efficiency and risk 
assessment of the private sector with the public purpose of the government sector. They work 
poorly when they rely on the efficiency and risk assessment of the government sector and the 
public purpose of the private sector.  
India should be careful not to undertake PPPs that do not apportion risks and responsibilities 
sensibly. Moreover flexibility needs to be built into arrangements so that the contract can be 
withdrawn and put up for rebid when the private party underperforms. The government needs 
to study the PPP experience and build some central capacity to help ministries, authorities, and 
states structure contracts and renegotiate troubled ones. 
3.	Models	of	Foreign	Investment	
3.1.	Why	the	Need	for	Foreign	investment?	
• In most developing countries like ours, domestic capital is inadequate to meet the purpose 
of economic growth. 
• The inflow of foreign capital helps in removing the balance of payment over time. 
• By taxing the profits of foreign enterprise, the developing countries mobilize funds for 
development projects. 
• Foreign capital contributes to the generation of employment. 
• Foreign investment fills the gaps in management, entrepreneurship, technology and skill.

• Investment in the businesses by foreign citizens usually involving majority stock ownership 
of the enterprise 
• Joint ventures between the foreign and domestic companies

3.2.1.	Forms	of	FDI	
There are two types of FDI 
• Greenfield  Investment: It  is  the 
direct investment in new facilities 
or  the  expansion  of  existing 
facilities. It is the principal mode 
of  investing  in  developing 
countries. 
• Mergers  and  Acquisition: It 
occurs when a transfer of existing 
assets  from  local  firms  takes 
place. 
3.2.2.	Why	FDI	preferred?	
• It is of non-debt creating nature. 
• It  is  also  less  prone  to  quick 
reversals. South-east Asian crisis 
emanated due to the reversals of 
short-term capital inflows.

3.2.3.	Revised	FDI	Policy	
Recently,    India’s 
Department    for 
Promotion of Industry 
and Internal  Trade 
revised  its  FDI  policy 
in  order  to  curb  the 
possibility of 
predatory   foreign 
investment  exploiting 
the  financial  distress 
of    COVID-19-hit 
Indian companies. 
In the last five years, 
Chinese investment in 
India  has  drastically 
increased  from  US 
$1.6 billion in 2014 to 
at least US $26 billion 
in 2019 (both current and planned), in particular in technology start-up segment.  
In  the  light  of  this,  it  was  anticipated  that  Chinese  entities  would  take  advantage  of  the 
economic slump caused by the COVID-19 outbreak to raise their stakes in Indian entities and 
companies, exposing them to hostile and opportunistic takeovers. To avoid such a situation, FDI 
policy has been revised to curb opportunistic takeovers or acquisitions of Indian companies. 
Changes in FDI Policy  
• The present policy states that a non-resident entity can invest in India, subject to the FDI 
Policy except in those sectors/activities which are prohibited.  
o Additional Provision: A citizen of Bangladesh and Pakistan or an entity registered in 
both countries can only invest under the government route.  
o Additionally, for Pakistan sectors/activities such as defense, space and atomic energy 
are prohibited for investment in addition to the sectors/activities already prohibited.   
• The amended policy states that an entity of a country, which shares a land border with 
India or where the beneficial owner of investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of 
any such country, can invest only under the Government route.  
o This implies that the scope of the above-mentioned additional provision has been 
expanded to all our neighbours (including China). The government has refrained from 
explicitly mentioning China.  
• Additionally, the amendment also states that the transfer of ownership of an existing or 
future FDI in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership 
falling  within  the  restrictions  imposed  by  the  above  rule  will  also  require  government 
approval.  
o The  guideline  was  created  to  check  multi-layered  transactions  which  traced  the 
beneficial ownership to the seven land border sharing countries. 
o This  implies  that  private  equity  investors  and  venture  capital  funds  that  have 
investments from China (or any other land border sharing country) will also need prior 
approval before they make any investment, even ones that have already been pledged.  
 
Rising Chinese Investments and related concerns 
Until  2014,  the  net  Chinese  investment  in  India  was  and  bilateral  trade  relationship  was  highly 
transactional  i.e.  limited  to  imports  and  exports,  and  there  was  negligible  interdependence.  However,

Student Notes: 
2014  marks  the  entry  of  the  Chinese  private  sector  at  a  large  scale  in  India  and  subsequent  influx  of 
Chinese capital and investments in infrastructure, automobiles, energy, real estate and consumer goods 
sectors.  
Since  then,  Chinese  investors  have  invested  around  $4  billion  into  90  start-ups  in  India  and  18  of  the 
country’s  30  unicorn  start-ups  are  funded  by  Chinese  investors.  While  there  are  benefits  in  pursuing 
investment from China in terms of capital-hungry Indian startups which can benefit from the experience 
and technological know-how of Chinese companies that have achieved a bigger scale and success in their 
own home market in similar vertical. But the concerns need to be considered as well:  
Concerns associated with these investments  
• Concerns with such penetration: Data security, propaganda and platform control.   
• China’s State-owned enterprises (SOEs), provincial governments were source of around 50% Chinese 
investments in India. These have become an important tool in China’s diplomacy. Also, it is difficult to 
differentiate between private sector and SOEs as many times they are indirectly related.  
• These  investments  (including  the  private  sector  investments)  are  part  of  China’s  “Made  in  China 
2025”  plan.  This  plan  is  aimed  at  acquisition  of  technology.  This  is  evident  through  investments  in 
Indian technology startups like PayTM by tech giants like Alibaba.   
• India’s investment scrutiny mechanism may not be as robust as in developed countries. For instance, 
As  of  September  2019,  the  US,  Australia,  and  Japan  were  among  countries  that  have  blocked 
Huawei, a private sector giant with close state ties, from their 5G plans. India has not taken a final 
call, although it has allowed Huawei to participate in initial 5G trials.  
• Increasing  investment  in  sensitive  sectors  such  as  news  services,  fin-tech  services  etc.  can  be 
detrimental in the context of privacy of user data and data security. For ex. ByteDance, which plays 
key role in censorship in China, has invested $25 million in Indian news aggregator Dailyhunt. 
Challenges in implementation of the policy   
• Impact on funding for start-ups: Funding for unicorns, smaller start-ups may be hit as 
several investors may get discouraged if asked to go through government route.  
o For example, upcoming fundin grounds of India's top start-up unicorns including Paytm, 
Zomato, Big Basket and Dream11 may get dampened.  
• More clarity needed: Further clarification is required on the reporting mechanism and 
identification  of  beneficial  ownership  structures  such  as  the  percentage  of  holding  to 
ensure full compliance.  
• China alleges flouting of norms: China states that the barriers created by the policy for 
investors from specific countries violate WTO’s principle of non-discrimination.  
o India’s stand: India has categorically denied China’s allegations regarding its FDI policy. 
India has given following reasoning-  
§ The revised policy neither restricts market access nor national treatment— the two 
tenets of global trade-—and is thus not violative of any rules of the WTO.  
§ On the investment front, the measure does not fall within the Illustrative List of the 
Agreement  on  Trade-Related  Investment  Measures  (TRIMS),  which  details  the 
measures that are inconsistent with the obligation of national treatment.  
• Spill over on neighbourhood relations: Expansion of restrictions to all land border sharing 
countries may indirectly affect the FDI from countries such as Myanmar.  
Way forward  
Chinese investment in India has the potential to rebalance an extremely lopsided trading 
relationship.  Although  Chinese  stakes  are  increasing  in  Indian  companies,  India  has  also 
emerged among the key overseas markets for several Chinese companies which can be better 
leveraged by India’s trade strategy to balance the trading relationship or secure market access 
for Indian firms in China.  
In the light of this, there is a need to strike a better balance between creating a friendly, open 
and  predictable  investment  environment  on  one  hand,  and  safeguarding  longer-term 
considerations of security and privacy on the other.

3.3.	Foreign	Institutional	Investors	
• Foreign Institutional Investors (FII s) means an entity established or incorporated outside 
India  which  proposes  to  make  investment  in  India.  Positive  tidings  about  the  Indian 
economy combined with a fast-growing market have made India an attractive destination 
for FIIs. 
• FII inflows are called 'hot money' because they can be taken out any time. 
According to recently changed guidelines, the investment of up to 10%  of the project cost is 
categorized as FPI and above that limit comes under the category of FDI. 
3.4.	Recent	Initiatives	to	promote	Foreign	Investment	
3.4.1.	Expansion	of	Qualified	Foreign	Investors	(QFIs)	Scheme	
• In Budget 2011-12, the government, for the first time, permitted Qualified Foreign Investors 
(QFIs), who meet the know-your-customer (KYC) norms, to invest directly in Indian MFs. 
• In June 2012, the definition of QFI was expanded to include residents of the member 
countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and European Commission (EC) as the GCC 
and EC are the members of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). 
3.4.2.	Categorization	of	NRI	investment	as	domestic	investment		
There is proposal to categorize the NRI investment as domestic investment, by giving same 
benefits as are entitled by the domestic investor. This has the effect of extending the room for 
foreign  investors  in  Indian  economy,  as  a  major  part  of  it  would  be  counted  as  domestic 
investment. 
3.4.3.	 What	 More	 Needs	 to	 be	 Done	 to	 Promote	 Investment	 and	 Increase	
Efficiency	of	Investment?	
• Making the Infrastructure Project Commercially Viable - This is the first and foremost thing 
we should do for financing infrastructure in a sustainable manner. As mentioned earlier 
infrastructure projects involve huge financing requirements, most of which are met by 
banks and other financial institutions directly and indirectly. Thus, it is very important to 
make the project commercially viable to ensure regular servicing of the loan. This will lead 
to sustainable development of infrastructure without jeopardizing the soundness of the 
financial sector. Project appraisal and follow-up capabilities of many banks, particularly 
public sector banks, also need focused attention and upgradation so that project viability 
can be properly evaluated and risk mitigants provided where needed. 
• Greater Participation of State Governments - In a federal country like India, participation 
and support of the State governments is essential for developing high quality infrastructure. 
The  State  governments’  support  in  maintenance  of  law  and  order,  land  acquisition, 
rehabilitation  and  settlement  of  displaced  persons,  shifting  of  utilities,  and  obtaining 
environmental  clearances  are  necessary  for  the  projects  undertaken  by  the  Central 
Government or the private sector. It is satisfying to know that many State governments 
have also initiated several PPP projects for improving infrastructure. 
• Improving efficiency of the Corporate Bond Market - Vibrant corporate bond market will 
reduce the dependence on the banking sector for funds. Further, coordinated regulatory 
initiatives could be considered in the areas involving standardization of stamp duties on 
corporate bonds across the states, encouraging public issuance and bringing in institutional 
investors in a big way. It is also important to broad base the investor base by bringing in 
new classes of institutional investors (like insurance companies, pension funds, provident 
funds, etc.) apart from banks into this market. 
• Credit Enhancement - One of the major obstacles in attracting foreign debt capital for 
infrastructure is the sovereign credit rating ceiling. Domestic investors are also inhibited 
due to high level of credit risk perception, particularly in the absence of sound bankruptcy

the investment norms, risk perceptions and actual ratings 
• Simplification of Procedures – Enabling Single Window Clearance - It is well recognized 
that while funding is the major problem for infrastructure financing, there are other issues 
which aggravate the problems of raising funds. These include legal disputes regarding land 
acquisition,  delay  in  getting  other  clearances  (leading to  time  and  cost  overruns)  and 
linkages (e.g. coal, power, water, etc.) among others. It is felt that in respect of mega-
projects, beyond certain cut-off point, single window clearance approach could cut down 
the implementation period.

1. Revisiting PPP model is key for India's investment led growth. Analyze. 
Approach: 
• Define PPP and briefly discuss the status of PPP in India. 
• Discuss the significance of PPP model for investment led growth in India.  
• List the various issues plaguing the PPP model in India and explain them briefly. 
• Briefly conclude on the basis of aforementioned points. 
Answer: 
A Private Public Partnership (PPP) is a long-term contract between a private party and a 
government entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private party 
shares risk & management responsibility and, remuneration is linked to performance. 
Significance of PPPs: 
PPPs augment both delivery and financing of public projects. The limited capacity of 
public  resources for  investment  in  infrastructure  coupled  with  the  magnitude  of 
investment required makes PPP a viable alternative for the government to enhance 
investment in infrastructure in India. The growth in the number of PPP projects during 
the past decades has made India the leading PPP market in the world.  
Besides making up for the shortfall in investment in infrastructure in India, PPPs also 
bring  in new  and  cost-effective  technology for  creation  of  infrastructure  assets, 
managerial  efficiency,  and  superior  competencies  in service  standards for  the 
operation and maintenance of public assets. This results in timely and high-quality 
infrastructure services to end users.

Student Notes: 
Need for revisiting PPP Model & reforms required:  
Despite  India  offering  the  world’s  largest  market  for  PPPs,  their  role  in  the 
infrastructure delivery mechanism over the last decade has remained limited. This has 
been due to various issues, such as disputes in existing contracts, non-availability of 
capital  and  regulatory  hurdles  related  to  the  acquisition  of  land, inadequate  due 
diligence by project developers, etc. Thus, there is a need to revisit the PPP model and 
following can be some of the steps that can be taken in this regard: 
• Optimal risk allocation and management: Inefficient and inequitable allocation of 
risk is a major factor behind failure of PPPs. Hence, optimal risk allocation must be 
ensured across all stakeholders by allocating it to the entity that is best suited to 
manage the risk. A generic risk monitoring and evaluation framework should also 
be developed. 
• Strengthening  policy  and  governance: An  institution  providing  guidance  for  a 
national  PPP  policy;  mechanism  for  capturing  and collating  data  for  decision 
making;  and  capacity  building  activities  shall  invigorate  private  investments  in 
infrastructure. 
• Strengthening institutional capacity: Lack of capacity within statutory authorities 
and excessive government oversight hampers PPP in India. Independent regulators 
must be set up in sectors that are going for PPPs. An Infrastructure PPP Project 
Review Committee may be set up to evaluate PPP projects.  
• Strengthening  legal  framework: A  quick,  efficient,  and  enforceable  dispute 
resolution mechanism will address long delays in implementation of projects. PPP 
contracts should have clearly articulated dispute resolution structures that also 
provide flexibility to restructure within the commercial and financial boundaries of 
the project.  
• Strengthening  contracts: Since  infrastructure  projects  are  long  term,  a  private 
developer may lose bargaining power because of abrupt changes in the economic 
or policy environment. Hence, private sector must be protected against such loss of 
bargaining  power. This  could  be  ensured  by  amending  the  terms  of  the  PPP 
contracts to allow for renegotiations. 
PPP’s are important for India considering the limited fiscal space and the substantial 
scale of investments required in meeting the infrastructure gaps and achieving the 
growth  target.  In  this  context,  it  is  pertinent  for  timely  implementation  of  the 
recommendations  of  Vijay  Kelkar  Committee  to  eliminate  the  deterrent  factors 
hampering PPP in India. These include rebalancing of risk sharing; multi-disciplinary 
expert institutional mechanisms to resolve legacy issues; developing sector specific 
institutional frameworks & umbrella guidelines for stressed projects; restricting the 
number of banks in a consortium; reviewing contractual processes & reinvigorating 
sectors.

Answer: 
The Swiss Challenge method is a form of public procurement wherein a private party 
identifies a project suo-moto and submits the proposal to the government. Thereafter, 
the government evaluates whether the party’s technical, commercial, managerial and 
financial  capabilities  are  adequate  for  undertaking  the  project  and  forwards  the 
proposal  along  with  its  evaluation  to  the  concerned  infrastructure  authority  for 
approval. The authority might recommend modifications following which the original 
proponent may reconsider/modify its proposal and resubmit it.  
The government then starts a competitive bidding process for the project wherein it 
asks other players to put in their bids for the same project. The proponent with the best 
plan is awarded the contract. However, in some cases, there are provisions where the 
original proposer is paid for the intellectual property and is also given the ‘Right of first 
refusal’ i.e. only if it refuses to carry out the project, a third party will get the contract. 
In India, the method was upheld by the Supreme Court for awarding public projects. 
The government has also implemented this method in road and railway projects, IT 
sector, etc. 
The benefits of the model are: 
• Allows better price discovery: It allows the party to mix-and-match the features of 
an open auction and a closed tender, so as to reach the optimum price.  
• Certainty of success: As there will always be one willing partner available from 
beginning of the project, there are fewer chances of default on the project.  
• Initiative  in  developing  a  public  need: The  private  players  will  work  towards 
resolving the public need through innovative solutions and new technology.  
• Better Project Structuring: Interested parties will conduct pre-project studies in 
advance, allowing early identification of risks and timelines and time and cost 
saving measures.  
• Resolution of stressed assets: If the model is applied to bankruptcy cases, banks 
may be able to squeeze out more capital from the auction of stressed assets as 
observed in the recent bankruptcy cases of some cement companies.  
• Promotes enterprise: This model cuts red tape and rewards the private sector for 
its ideas. Further, it not only promotes public-private partnership but also increases 
competition and efficiency among the private participants.  
The issues associated with the model include: 
• Lack of transparency: The Vijay Kelkar Committee on PPP in India discouraged 
unsolicited Swiss Challenge proposals as these bring information asymmetries into 
the procurement process due to poor disclosures. 
• Lack of adequate regulatory framework: There are no adequate regulatory and 
legal  frameworks  for  awarding  projects  and  for  dispute  resolution  under  this 
method. . 
• Crony capitalism: This method could breed crony capitalism by allowing companies 
to employ dubious means to bag projects. It can also promote favouritism by 
allowing a bidder to initiate an idea and give the right of first refusal. 
• Bidding asymmetry: There is asymmetry among different players due to time given 
to  bidders  to  prepare  counter  proposals  vis-à-vis  time  taken  by  the  original 
proposer for preparation.  
However, these inefficiencies can be overcome by instituting a Central Swiss Challenge 
Policy  with  remedial  provisions.  Further,  there  is  a  need  to  clearly  demarcate  the 
authority that needs to be approached with the upcoming project plans.

3. A worrying trend for Indian economy has been the decline in private investment in the 
past few years. Highlight the reasons behind it. What steps should be taken to revive 
private investment in the economy? 
Approach: 
• Introduce by highlighting the importance of private investment in India and its 
status.  
• Give reasons behind the decline in private investment. 
• Enumerate  the  steps  which  can  be  taken  to  revive  private  investment  in  the 
economy. 
• Conclude on the basis of the above points.  
Answer: 
As per the Economic Survey 2018-19, private investment is the “key driver” that drives 
demand, creates capacity, increases labour productivity, introduces new technology, 
allows  creative  destruction  and  generates  jobs.  It  can  help  India  to  make  use  of 
favourable demographic phase. However, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in 
the private sector has declined from around 27 percent in 2011 to around 21 percent in 
2018. 
Reasons behind decline in private investment 
• Twin-Balance Sheet problem: On the one hand, companies are overleveraged and 
unable to pay interest payments from loans. On the other hand, banks are stressed 
with mounting Non Performing Assets that reached 11.5% of total loans in March 
2018. Due to this, the growth in the bank credit to industry has witnessed a sharp 
fall from around 24% of the GDP in 2010 to around 7% in 2019.  
• Economic  policy  uncertainty: A  series  of  decisions  like  demonetisation,  BS  VI 
emission norms, lack of clarity over government statistics has created apprehension 
in  the  minds  of  investors.  Further,  NBFC  crisis,  its  persistence  and  continuing 
defaults have added uncertainty. 
• Vicious cycle of demand and investment: Low investor confidence has spilled over 
to consumers as well, as they witness job losses with dried up investments. This 
drives low spending by consumers which further weakens the demand and impacts 
investments  by  the  private  sector,  as  consumption  is  a  crucial  input  for  their 
volume, revenue and cost projections.  
• Lack of key structural reforms in different sectors have discouraged the private 
sector to invest vigorously, such as, unresolved problems in the power sector, fresh 
troubles and insolvencies in aviation and telecom, and fragilities in real estate, 
housing and infrastructure etc.  
Steps needed to revive private investment- 
• Financial  institutions’  reforms: By  strengthening  the  banking  and  non-banking 
sectors, there could be push by increasing purchasing power capacity of people, 
which can further revive consumption and investment.  
• Development of Corporate Bond Market: A well-functioning debt market can help 
reduce the burden on the banking sector for raising investments. 
• Predictable policy actions by the policymakers, which are consistent with the broad 
vision of the economy is imperative. Investors can then relate to the logic behind 
the policy and therefore not get disturbed by the policy changes. 
• Sustained structural reforms must be continued in the areas of bankruptcy code, 
labour  code  consolidation,  building  infrastructure,  suitable  tax  cuts,  enabling 
foreign direct investment etc.

Student Notes: 
The recent corporate tax cuts may be a more effective measure to induce bigger 
investments over the medium term. Yet much more would be required to change the 
trend in private investment and to sustain India’s growth. Given the constraints on 
public  investment  due  to  India’s  elevated  public  debt  and  the  government’s  fiscal 
consolidation path, there is an urgent need to activate stalled projects and clean up 
balance sheets of corporate firms and the banking sector to revive the investment 
cycle. It is important to revive the overall investment, especially in infrastructure, for 
balanced growth. 
 
4. What  is  the  rationale  behind  government  tapping  into  private  resources  for  large 
infrastructure projects? In this context, highlight the various problems that can arise 
in a PPP contract and list the measures that have been taken to minimise them. 
Approach: 
• Discuss the rationale behind government tapping into private resources for large 
infrastructure projects. 
• Highlight the various problems that can arise in a PPP contract. 
• List the measures that have been taken to minimize them. 
Answer: 
In developing countries, the governments are faced with resource constraints and may 
lack expertise in planning or executing large projects. So the private sector participation 
can generate more efficiencies by creating more competition, realization of economies 
of  scale  and  greater  flexibility.  Moreover  the  costs  incurred  in  implementing  and 
running these projects may be recovered from those who use them, rather than putting 
the  burden  on  everybody  by  way  of  tax  collections.  Thus,  the  rationale  behind 
government tapping into private resources is to harness the managerial and technical 
expertise and support it with government’s wisdom.  
Problems that can arise in a PPP contract 
• Delayed  execution  due  to  problems  in  land  acquisition,  utility  shifting, poor 
performance of contractors, delays in environment/ forest/wildlife clearances etc.  
• Public agitations for additional facilities, and arbitration/contractual disputes with 
contractors etc. 
• Non-availability  of long-term capital,  contraction  in  development  finance 
institutions and too much reliance on banks hamper the economic viability of 
projects. 
• The firms engaging in opportunistic behaviour by bidding low and recover later by 
demanding the renegotiation of a contract. 
• Unpredictability or inability to predict future risk associated with project leads to 
companies walking out and demanding renegotiation. 
• Inability of ill-equipped public sector partners like local or decentralized entity to 
meet  the  requirements  of  designing  and  supervising  the  project  or  handling 
disputes. 
Measures that can be taken to minimize problems in a PPP contract 
• Bringing out a model PPP contract which is definitive and clear so that there is 
minimum scope of litigation at later stage. 
• Giving flexibility in contracts so that unforeseen circumstances may be factored in 
at later stage. 
• Regular meetings, frequent reviews and constant monitoring to deal with the issues 
delaying project completion.

Student Notes: 
• Streamlining of land acquisition and environment clearance procedure.  
• Revamping of dispute resolution mechanism to timely resolve disputes to expedite 
project execution.  
• Adoption of Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) instead of Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction (EPC) to facilitate speedy implementation of the projects. 
• Mandatory  norms  to  explore  the bond market  to  finance  long  gestation 
infrastructure project. Also, the norms to enable pension and insurance funds to 
invest in such projects may be relaxed. 
• Adopting the ‘Infrastructure Investment Trusts route, other innovative financing 
options to attract fresh capital. 
• Monetization of projects through the Toll-Operate in Transfer model, securitization 
of toll revenue.  
Further, implementation of recommendations of Vijay Kelkar Committee on revisiting 
and revitalizing the PPP model can streamline and strengthen PPPs. 
 
5. By rebalancing project risks between the public and private sectors, the HAM model 
has encouraged investments in the road infrastructure sector. Discuss. 
Approach: 
• Explain the HAM model. 
• Elaborate how it is different than the previous PPP models in the road sector vis-à-
vis the risk sharing. 
• Discuss how it has rebalanced the public and private interests. 
Answer: 
The government introduced the Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) to revive PPP in India. 
HAM is a mix of EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) and BOT (Build, 
Operate, Transfer) models.  
Under the EPC model, NHAI pays private players to lay roads. The private player has no 
role in the road’s ownership, toll collection or maintenance. Under the BOT model 
though, private players have an active role — they build, operate and maintain the 
road  for  a  specified  number  of  years,  before  transferring  the  asset  back  to  the 
government. Under it, the private player arranges all the finances for the project, while 
collecting toll revenue or annuity fee from the Government, as agreed. Essentially, the 
toll revenue risk is taken by the government, while the private player is paid a pre-fixed 
annuity for construction and maintenance of roads. 
Now, HAM combines EPC (40 per cent) and BOT-Annuity (60 per cent). On behalf of the 
government, NHAI releases 40 per cent of the total project cost. It is given in five 
tranches linked to milestones. The balance 60 per cent is arranged by the developer. 
Here, the developer usually invests not more than 20-25 per cent of the project cost (as 
against 40 percent or more before), while the remaining is raised as debt. There is no 
toll right for the developer. 
 Risk allocation in different contract models: 
Type of Model Financing Risk Revenue Risk O & M Risk 
EPC NHAI NHAI NHAI 
BOT Private player Private player Private player 
HAM NHAI & Private NHAI NHAI  or  Private(  depending 
upon contract)

Student Notes: 
Advantage of HAM is that it gives enough liquidity to the developer since the financial 
risk is shared by the government. It takes away a part of the construction risk and the 
whole traffic risk that makes developers nervous. 
Due to above features, HAM has triggered a significant increase in projects awarded, 
with HAM projects accounting for around 46% of total awards in terms of highway 
length and 63% in terms of total value in the fiscal year 2017-18.   
 
 
6. In view of the growing significance of FinTech innovations, discuss the potential and 
challenges of mainstreaming FinTech in Indian economy. 
Approach: 
• Give the definition of fintech.  
• Explain the potential of the fintech sector in India.  
• Highlight the steps taken by the government and RBI.  
Answer: 
Fintech (financial technology) is the use of new technology to improve and automate 
the delivery and use of financial services. It includes products such as e-wallets, P2P 
lending, payment gateways etc.  
According to EY’s Fintech Adoption Index 2017, India has the second highest fintech 
adoption rate in the world. Fintech in India is advantageous due to the following 
reasons: 
• India has a youth demographic that is rapidly growing.  
• Smartphone penetration is witnessing an upsurge - from 53% in 2014 to 64% by 
2018.  
• The  financial  services  market  in  India  is  primarily  untapped,  with  40%  of  the 
population  having  no  association  with  any  bank  and  more  than  80%  of  the 
transactions carried out through cash.  
• Almost  90  percent  of  small  businesses  are  not  linked  to  formal  financial 
institutions. 
• Innovation-driven  startup  landscape  and  availability  of  investment  for  fintech 
sector.  
Despite the significant opportunity, there are several challenges to fintech adoption in 
India: 
• Poor infrastructure in terms of Internet Connectivity, unbanked population and low 
financial literacy.  
• High dependence on cash in financial transactions.  
• The costs of integrating fintech solutions for MSME’s are currently prohibitive.  
• Concerns around cyber security and frauds.  
• Regulatory  uncertainty – RBI  and  SEBI  are  yet  to  come  out  with  
comprehensive and separate guidelines. 
• From the fintech company’s perspective, lack of timely access to capital for risk 
management and investment, curtail innovation and prevent their operations from 
scaling up.  
The RBI has promoted the Unified Payments Interface and the Bharat Bill Payments 
System, as well as digital payments, P2P lending, and the use of automated algorithms 
to  offer  financial  advice.  The  government’s  Digital  India  program, India  Stack 
and National  Payments  Council  of  India  (NPCI)  have  provided  important  enabling 
platforms for technology innovators.

The government should focus on the creation of a 'regulatory sandbox' - a safe space 
for businesses and startups to co-create innovative products, services and business 
models, and also on providing cyber security. 
 
7. Why have Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in India not been able to achieve the desired 
objectives? In this context, suggest some measures to revive SEZs in India. 
Approach:  
• Briefly discuss the objectives with which SEZs were established in India.  
• Highlight the reasons for the failure of SEZs to achieve the desired objectives.  
• Suggest measures to revive SEZs.  
Answer: 
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in India were established to provide simplified procedure 
and hassle free environment for businesses and boost manufacturing and employment. 
Special trade and business laws applied to these zones to boost trade.  
Reasons for failure of SEZs 
• Lack of external infrastructural support such as connectivity to the ports, rail and 
airways. 
• Failure of state governments to pursue long term development of the region due to 
relatively shorter period for which they hold office.  
• Due  to  misuse  of  tax  concessions,  government  withdrew  tax  incentives.  Ex- 
Removal of MAT exemptions from 2011-12.  
• According to a Princeton research, SEZs sites are selected on real estate speculation 
rather than the economic potential of a region, thus undermining their potential.  
• Often sites are selectd to target specific ethnic and caste groups to create vote 
banks.  
Measures  
• States  may  be  allowed  to  open  their  own  Export  Promotion  Zones  (EPZs).  
Competition between states is expected to improve exports and help SEZs flourish. 
• There is a need for policy reforms, both at the Union and state level to create 
pockets of freer markets. Withdrawal of tax exemptions need revisit.  
• Baba Kalyani Committee’s recommendations to revive SEZs 
o Shift focus from export to economic  and employment growth.  
o Incentives for the manufacturing SEZs have to be based on specific parameters 
including demand, investment, employment and technology, value addition 
and inclusivity.  
o Development of last mile and first mile connectivity infrastructure.  
o The success of services sector like IT and ITES has to be replicated in health 
care, financial services, legal, repair and design services.  
o Simpler entry and exit processes. 
 
8. What are the issues that have limited the success of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in 
India? Mention some steps that can be taken to address them. 
Approach: 
• Briefly, write about the Special Economic Zones in India. 
• Highlight the issues that have limited the success of Special Economic Zones in 
India. 
• List the steps to address the highlighted issues.

Student Notes: 
Answer: 
In  India,  special  economic  zones  are  planned  as  growth  engines  that  can  boost 
manufacturing, augment exports and generate employment. It provides for special 
fiscal and regulatory measures to ensure hassle-free operations alongside state-of-the-
art infrastructure and support services. The units are set up under Special Economic 
Zones Act, 2005 as duty free regions to be treated as foreign territory for the purpose 
of trade operations and duties and tariffs. 
However, SEZs in India have seen limited success. For instance, presently 351 SEZs are 
notified out of which only 232 SEZs are operational. The reasons for such a scenario 
include: 
• In many SEZ’s, land procured for industrial units remained unutilized. Further, lack 
of flexibility to utilize land for different sectors hinders the developmental process. 
• Existence of multiple models of economic zones such as SEZ, coastal economic 
zone, National Investment and Manufacturing Zone etc. has created confusion and 
ambiguity about fiscal and regulatory regime. 
• Disadvantage  on  domestic  sales  due  to  application  of full  custom  duty,  as 
compared to the lower rates with other countries due to free-trade agreement 
(FTA).  
• Imposition of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) (2012) as well as income tax on new 
SEZs (2017)  and  new  units  (2020)  has  made  it  less  attractive  for  industrial 
establishment.   
• Lack of support from the state government when it comes to developing effective 
single-window system for speedy clearances.  
• Failure to select SEZ sites that offer maximum development potential. Sites are 
selected on the basis of real estate speculation rather than the economic potential 
of a region. 
Steps to address them 
• Ensure optimal utilization of vacant land in SEZ. Also, allow flexibility of land use 
and remove sector-specific constraints. 
• Align  the  policy  framework  to  avoid  competition  among  similar  schemes  and 
provide ease of doing business to developers and tenants. 
• Simpler entry and exit processes using time-bound online approval and dispute 
resolution through robust arbitration and commercial courts.  
• Development of last mile and first mile connectivity infrastructure by government 
should  be  provided  for  land  parcels  which  are  far  from  highways  and  urban 
agglomerations. 
• Fast tracking various approvals through online application process. 
• Grant infrastructure status to buildings of SEZs and industrial parks in order to ease 
funding. 
Going forward, lessons can also be taken from China where SEZs have produced better 
results.  Recent  recommendations  of  Baba  Kalyani  Committee,  which  envisages 
reincarnation of SEZs as Employment and Economic Enclaves (3Es) also needs to be 
discussed further.

9. Private  investment  is  a  key  driver  that  catalyses an  economy  into  a  self-sustaining 
cycle of growth. Explaining the statement, highlight the steps that should be taken to 
revive private investment in India. 
Approach: 
• Briefly discuss the need for private investment and explain how it can lead to self 
sustaining cycle of growth.  
• Giving a brief scenario of private investment, highlight few steps that need to be 
taken to revive private investment in India. 
• Conclude briefly. 
Answer: 
To achieve the objective of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25, India needs 
to sustain a real GDP growth of 8 percent. International experience of fast growing East 
Asian economies suggest that such high growth can be achieved by a virtuous cycle of 
savings  and  investment  along  with  favourable  demographic  phase.  Investments, 
especially,  private  investments  drive  demand,  create  capacity;  increases  labor 
productivity, introduce new technology, allow creative destructions and generate jobs.  
Also, in a developing country like India, the Government has greater social obligations 
and lesser resources. Thus, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) through government 
investment is usually limited and its share as a percentage of GDP remains largely 
unchanged. It is the private sector that needs to pump investment in the economy in 
order to usher in a virtuous cycle of investment led growth, employment, increasing 
incomes and consumption. Thus, as identified by economic survey 2018-19, private 
investment is a key driver of growth. This has especially to be in capital intensive 
sectors such as infrastructure.  
Reviving private investment: Reasons for its decline 
Private  investment  accounts  for  three  quarters  of  GFCF  (Gross  Fixed  Capital 
Formation), an indicator of investment which is declining. Private investment continues 
to face impediments in the forms of Twin Balance Sheet Problems, excess industrial 
capacity and regulatory and policy challenges, putting downside pressures on India’s 
potential growth. 
Steps taken to revive Private investment: 
Various steps that have been taken by the government to revive private investment 
include bankruptcy law, tax reforms like GST, higher infrastructural push, efforts to 
reform  banking  sectors,  introduction  of  financing  models  like  Hybrid  Annuity, 
rationalizing monetary policy, and recapitalization of banks.  
Further measures required: 
• Structural issues like increasing the extent of formalisation 
o this would increase the savings, so that more funds are available to be lent. 
o make more business units eligible for formal credit through recognition of their 
income.  
o spur consumption by expected reduction in taxes due to more collections by 
the government as a result of formalisation.  
• Bringing in a coherent and transparent policy and regulatory framework to improve 
upon ease of doing business along with bringing in desired land and labour reforms 
like  model  land  lease  act  and  labour  codes.  This  will  create  an  enabling 
environment for private investment and will minimize risks and uncertainties of 
returns for investors.

Student Notes: 
• Faster resolution of pending insolvency cases will give banks more space for credit. 
• Checking the crowding out of private investment by the public investment through 
robust monetary policy. 
• Measures to reduce the cost of capital and to rationalize the risk return trade off 
for private investment. 
• Evolving a robust export policy factoring in the ongoing global trade war, WTO 
challenges and emerging bilateral trading platforms.  
Thus, a large domestic market having the potential of rising demand and an increased 
private investment coupled with rising exports can  create a self sustaining cycle of 
growth. 
 
10. Highlighting  the  issues  faced  in  BOT  and  EPC  models  of  infrastructure  investment, 
explain how HAM can address these. 
Approach:  
• Explain the two models and discuss their shortcomings. 
• Explain about HAM and how it addresses these problems. 
Answer:  
BOT (Build Operate Transfer) and EPC (Engineering Procurement Construction) have 
been the two frequently used PPP models for infrastructure development in India. 
Under BOT, private players build, operate and maintain infrastructure for a specified 
period  before  transferring  the  asset  back  to  government.  Private  players  arrange 
finances  while  collecting  toll  revenue  or  annuity  fee  from  the  government.  The 
government may or may not undertake the risk of any shortfall in toll revenue. 
Issues with BOT 
• Private players have to fully arrange for finance and NPA-riddled banks are reluctant 
to lend.  
• In cases of non-fixed compensation structure, developers have to take on the entire 
risk of low passenger traffic.  
• Delays and cost overrun due to environmental clearances and land acquisition 
worsens finances. 
In EPC, the government finances the project and does land acquisition while the private 
player procures material and constructs infrastructure. EPC was the preferred mode for 
highway projects during 2013-15. 
Issues with EPC 
• Cost escalation and shrinking margins due to land acquisition issues, delays in 
approvals etc.  
• Unrealistically low estimates and stringent payment terms in most contracts.  
• Inherent limitation of financial resources available with the government. 
HAM model: 
HAM (Hybrid Annuity Model) tries to overcome these limitations by combining EPC 
(40%) and BOT-Annuity (60%). Government releases 40% of total project cost, in five 
tranches that are linked to milestones. Balance 60% is arranged by developer – who 
usually invests ≤20-25% of project cost and raises the remaining amount as debt.  
Benefits of HAM: 
• It spreads the risk between developers and government. Also, the government 
provides viability-gap funding.

Student Notes: 
• Regulatory clearances risk, compensation risk, commercial risk and traffic risk are 
borne by government, thus helping cut overall debt and improving project returns.  
• Annuity payment structure saves developers from traffic risk. 
• Government gets an opportunity to flag off road projects by investing a portion of 
project cost.  
• While it does take the traffic risk, it also earns better social returns by way of access 
and convenience to daily commuters. 
 
 
11. Special  Purpose  Vehicles  (SPVs)  are  fast  becoming  an  important  avenue  for 
channelising  funds  for  projects  in  infrastructure  sector.  Explaining  the  concept  of 
SPVs,  highlight  some  of  the  benefits  and  risks  associated  with  them.  Also,  suggest 
measures to manage the risks identified. 
Approach: 
•
 Explain the concept of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) along with example. 
•
 Mention some of the benefits and risks associated with SPVs. 
•
 Suggest some measures so as to overcome the risks. 
Answer: 
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a legal entity which is formed for a single, well-defined 
lawful purpose. It is a hybrid of a government-controlled body along with the efficiency 
of  the  private  sector.  Technically,  an  SPV  is  limited  company  which  is  setup  in 
accordance to the provisions under Companies Act, 2013. It’s ownership can be public, 
private or joint. There is generally a sponsoring company of the SPV which provides 
initial capital and assets and helps the SPV in raising funds. SPVs are mostly formed for 
raising and lending funds, especially debt funds of longer maturity, directly to eligible 
projects to supplement loans from banks and financial institutions. For instance, SPV 
has been named as National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited to implement the 
project of Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Bullet Train.  
Benefits 
•
 
Professional  management- SPV  will  plan,  appraise,  approve,  release  funds, 
implement,  manage,  operate,  monitor  and  evaluate  the  development  projects. 
Example: The creation of SPVs for each smart city  
•
 
Minimal red tape- For instance, Invest India’s remit is not to make money for the 
shareholders, but to facilitate investments into India, hand-hold investors through 
the bureaucratic maze. 
•
 
Increased financial resilience- It helps in separating the risk and freeing up the 
capital. As a result, the SPV and the sponsoring company are protected against risks 
like insolvency, which may arise during the course of operation.  
•
 
Greater operational independence- Infrastructure projects are streamlined as they 
derive benefit from inter-linkages of academic institutions and organizations.  
•
 
Securitization  of  assets - SPVs  allows  securitization  without  disturbing  the 
managerial relationship. Under the arrangement, any predictable income stream 
generated by secure assets can be securitized. 
Risks associated 
•
 
Poor risk management and a misunderstanding of the risks of SPV usage has been a 
factor in a number of high profile failures. There are reputational risks for the 
financing  firm  as  well  as  risks  for  the  investors  in  an  SPV  because  of  lack  of 
transparency.

Further, poor performance of SPV can affect the sponsoring firm’s access to capital 
markets. For example, if the SPV to implement a highways project fails, it may 
inhibit the capacity of the private partner as well as the government to raise funds 
from market. 
•
 
Generating  dedicated  and  substantial  revenue  stream  so  as  to  make  it  self- 
sustainable remains a pertaining question. 
Overlapping jurisdictional mandates with the existing companies and institutions.  
Management of risks 
•
 
There should be regular oversight and monitoring of the use of SPV activity in 
order to identify developments that could lead to systematic weakness. 
•
 
Tightening reporting requirements and consolidation of account requirements for 
the use of SPVs. 
•
 
Governance structures of SPVs should be simplified by putting an end to layers 
upon layers of multi-tiered securitization. 
•
 
Through adequate awareness generation, market participants should be able to 
assess and risk manage factors that increase transaction capability. 
 
 
12. Coastal  Employment  Zones  (CEZs)  present  opportunities  both  in  terms  of  boosting 
export  led  growth  and creation  of  productive  jobs.  In  this  context,  discuss  the 
features, challenges & prospects of CEZs in India. 
Approach: 
•
 
Stating the recent NITI Aayog's proposal, mention the main features of Coastal 
Employment Zones (CEZs). 
•
 
Discuss the challenges and prospects of CEZs in India across multiple dimensions. 
Answer: 
•
 
NITI Aayog recently pitched for development of two Coastal Employment Zones 
(one each on the western and eastern coast) on the lines of a Chinese strategy to 
promote exports and create high productivity & good income jobs.  
Features of Coastal Employment Zones (CEZs) 
•
 
Each CEZ will be an agglomeration of multiple coastal districts, spread over a wide 
geographical area of 500 square kilometers or more.  
•
 
Flexible land conversion rules would help accommodate numerous inter-related 
economic activities on large scale, thereby generating economies of scale. 
•
 
It will provide the geographical boundary within which port led industrialization will 
be developed by having a uniform policy along the ports and coastal states.  
•
 
CEZs are expected to have liberal labour laws and other tax incentives such as 
limited period tax holiday etc. 
•
 
CEZs would facilitate ease of doing business, especially, ease of export and import, 
faster environmental clearances etc. 
•
 
Each CEZ would create urban spaces as residential provision for those employed in 
the zone. 
Challenges 
•
 
Non-availability of land parcels with the states along with huge acquisition and 
compensation costs can delay the execution of such projects. 
•
 
As per UNCTAD survey, such islands of excellence can create enormous political risk 
by excluding other regions from development.

Student Notes: 
•
 
Envisaged CEZ's potential may not be realized due to sub-optimal transport modal 
mix, lack of scale, low penetration of coastal and inland shipping etc. 
•
 
Due to subdued global demand, the supply efficiency from CEZs will take time to 
grow into full-fledged manner. 
•
 
Inclusion of ineligible land for notification, allotment of land far in excess of need 
and protracted non-use of notified land, may result in the diversion of CEZ land for 
more lucrative commercial exploitation. 
Prospects 
•
 
An export led coastal economy, based on labour intensive sectors such as apparel, 
footwear, electronic and electrical products etc would help create high productivity 
good jobs. 
•
 
Due to exit of many firms from China, India is well positioned in the international 
market to serve as export bases of the migrating firms.  
•
 
It would attract large firms which would bring with them technology, capital, good 
management and links to the world markets.  
•
 
By capturing agglomeration economies, it would generate an ecosystem around 
them in which productive cluster small and medium firms would emerge and 
flourish. 
•
 
CEZs  will  help  tap synergies  with the  planned  industrial  corridors like  Vizag 
Chennai Industrial Corridor and Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor. 
•
 
With the reduction of clearance time and normalization of duties, these zones 
would help in frictionless movement of imports and exports with the creation of 
bonded free-trade zones in the long term.  
Learning lessons from SEZs, initially it would be practical to limit the number of zones to 
a few, rather than spreading the resources thinly across different geographies. This 
would help ensure that many sector-specific zones and clusters emerge within each CEZ 
to fully exploit economies of scale and agglomeration.
